<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c010'>The crowd in the market-place and in the streets of
Ashburton began to thin as the afternoon crept on.
In vain did the showmen blow their trumpets, ring their
bells, and invite to their entertainments. Those who had
come to the fair had spent their loose cash. The proprietors
of the stalls offered their wares at reduced prices, but
found few purchasers. Young men who had been hired by
the farmers swaggered about singing or shouting, some
tipsy, others merely on the road to tipsiness. The ostlers
in the inns were harnessing horses to the traps, market
carts, gigs, dog-carts, that had brought in the farmers and
their wives. Empty waggons were departing. The roads
were full of streams of people flowing homeward to the
surrounding villages.</p>

<p class='c001'>Pasco Pepperill started with the schoolmaster. He had
surrendered Kate to her father. The reins were in his
hand, and he had whipped the cob, when he saw Coaker,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>the man from whom he had bought the wool, coming
towards him.</p>

<p class='c001'>The blood rushed into Pepperill’s face.</p>

<p class='c001'>“How d’ye do?” asked the farmer. “Going home?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I be,” answered Pasco, with constrained anger.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You’ll find all the wool there. I sent off the lot this
morning—three waggon-loads.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why did you not inform me?—and I would have
waited for it, and not come to the fair.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I did not know how the weather might  be—and  I
wished to be rid of it.” Coaker laughed.</p>

<p class='c001'>This angered Pasco further, and, losing command of
himself, he said, “’Twas  scurvy—that  selling me at such a
price when you knew wool was down.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That was your concern. Each man for himself. But
I reckon you’ve made a worse bargain at Brimpts, if, as
they tell me, you have bought the wood.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“How so? Is not the timber first-rate?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, the timber is good enough.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then what is wrong?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Have you been to Brimpts?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No—but  Quarm has.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then you don’t know the road. It is thus”—Coaker
made a motion with his hand up and down. “The waves
of the sea mountains high is nothing to it—and bad—the
road is! Lor’ bless y’! the cost o’ moving the timber when
cut will swallow up all the profits.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Pshaw! The distance from Ashburton is only three miles.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Better ten on a decent road. You’ll never get the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>timber drawn, or, if you do, farewell to all profits. But
when you have got it to  Ashburton—who will buy it there?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, Quarm has an idea of disposing of the oak to
the  Government—selling it to the dockyard at Devonport.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“How far off is that? Some five-and-twenty  miles—and
over the moor!” Coaker laughed.</p>

<p class='c001'>“If I don’t sell the oak, I am a”—Pasco’s face was
as red as blood. He checked himself from the confession
that he would be a ruined man, and said between his teeth,
“I’ll never speak to Quarm again. He’s led me into a
pretty quandary.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Quarm? He’s a Jack-o’-lantern—don’t trust he.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Coaker waved his hand, and, still laughing, went his way
to the stable-yard to get his cob.</p>

<p class='c001'>Pasco whipped his horse and drove homewards. His
lips were closed, his brows knitted, he looked straight before
him at the ears of his horse. He was in no disposition to
speak. Nor, for the matter of that, was his companion.
Bramber was thinking of Kitty, of the uncongenial surroundings,
the hot-headed father, running himself and his
brother-in-law into speculative ventures that must lead them
to ruin; of the uncle, boastful, conceited, and withal
stupid; of the hard, selfish aunt. He saw that young
Pooke admired her, and this did not altogether please
Bramber. Pooke might be well off and amiable, but he
was dull of intellect—a  boor—and  could never be a suitable
companion to the eager Kitty, whose mind was greedy for
knowledge, and whose tastes were those of a class above
that in which she was cast. The admiration of Jan Pooke
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>brought on her contrariety. It had involved her in the
quarrel between Jan and Noah, and had roused the jealousy
of Rose Ash.</p>

<p class='c001'>As the trap passed out of Ashburton, many a salutation
was cast at Pepperill, but he hardly acknowledged any.
He put up his hand and beat his hat down over his brows,
then lashed savagely at his cob.</p>

<p class='c001'>All at once something arrested his eye, and he instinctively
drew up, then muttered, and whipped his brute again.
What he had observed was a little plate, affixed to a house,
with the title of the Insurance Company on it, with which
he had that day had dealings.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I wonder,” thought Pasco, “what that house is insured
for? Not for twelve hundred pounds, I’ll swear.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then a sense of bitterness rose in his heart against his
brother-in-law for drawing him into this expense of insuring
his  property;—he had that day expended all the gold he
had about him in paying the first premium. There remained
only some silver in one pocket, and coppers in the other.
Where was he to find the money for the payment of the
oaks he had bought? Where that to meet the bill for the
wool? The tanner would not pay enough for the bark to
cover the cost of rending. Quarm had told him that the
sap rose badly, and that it would involve much labour and
waste of time to attempt to bark the trees.</p>

<p class='c001'>Fevered with anxiety and disappointment, Pasco thrashed
his cob savagely, and sent it along at its fullest pace,
whirling past the gigs and waggons returning from the fair,
and giving the drivers hardly time to get on one side to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>avoid him. He relieved his breast by swearing at them
for their sluggishness in making way, and some retaliated
with oaths, as, in order to escape him, they ran into the
hedge or over a heap of stones.</p>

<p class='c001'>Presently his horse slackened speed, as it reached a
sharp ascent, and there Pasco met an empty waggon, with
“Coaker—Dart-meet” on it. He stopped his panting horse,
and shouted to the driver of the team, and asked whence
he came.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I’ve been to your place—Coombe  Cellars,” answered
the waggoner. “Master sent me with a load of
fleeces.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Did my wife give you anything?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not a glass of cider,” answered the man. “We had to
unload and do the work of hoisting into the warehouse
ourselves—no one was about.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“She left it for me—she  knew you would meet us.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Tossing his head, to shake off the depression that had
come upon him, and with a flash of his vanity through the
gloom, he put his hand in his pocket and drew out a couple
of shillings.</p>

<p class='c001'>“There,” said he; “you’d have had more, but I have
spent most of my cash at the fair. Buying, buying,
buying, that’s my trade. Go and drink a glass to my
health.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then he drove on.</p>

<p class='c001'>On descending the hill another waggon was encountered.
This was also one that had conveyed fleeces to Coombe
Cellars. Pasco gave this driver a couple of shillings.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>Then he turned to Bramber and said, “Two years of
wool—I  paid as much as thirteen pence a pound, and I
can’t sell at tenpence. They say it is going down to
sevenpence; that is nearly half what I gave. A loss to me
of sixpence a pound; I have bought three waggonload.
A good sheep may have sixteen pounds on his back, but
the average is ten or eleven. Coaker must keep a couple
of hundred. You’re a schoolmaster; reckon that up—two
hundred sheep at eleven. I’m not a quick man at figures
myself.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nothing can be simpler than that calculation. Two
thousand two hundred.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah! But two years’ wool?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, that is four thousand four hundred.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And I have lost, say, sixpence a pound.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then you lose a hundred and ten pounds by the
transaction.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Think of that. A hundred and ten pounds—say a
hundred and twenty. That is something for a man to lose
and make no account of.” The vanity of the man was
flattered by the thought of the amount of his loss. “And
then,” said he, “there was what Coaker said about the oak.
I’ve undertaken to lay out two hundred pounds on that;
and there is the fellin’ and cartin’—say another hundred.
Suppose I lose this also—that is a matter of three hundred.
With the wool, four hundred and twenty pound. I reckon,
schoolmaster, you’ve never had the fingering of so much
money as I am losing.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Bramber looked round at Pasco with surprise. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>could not understand the sort of pride that was manifesting
itself in the man.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Are you able to meet such losses?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If not—I can but fail. It’s something to fail for a good
sum. But I’ll not fail; I am full of resources.” He beat
the horse. “I shall sell the wool. It will go up. I shall
sell the timber at a good figure, and pocket a thousand
pounds. I am sorry I did not give those men half a crown
each, but I have spent most of my money, and”—</p>

<p class='c001'>Crash! He drove against a post, and upset the trap.</p>

<p class='c001'>Pasco staggered to his feet.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Schoolmaister—are you hurt?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No.” Walter sprang to the horse and seized its
head.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It would have been best had I broken my neck and
finished so,” said Pepperill. Then he regretted the sudden
outburst of despair, and added, “So some folks might ha’
said, but I’ve disappointed ’em. I may have a chuck
down, but I’m up again in a <a id='corr13.19'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='jiffey'>jiffy</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_13.19'><ins class='correction' title='jiffey'>jiffy</ins></a></span>. That’s been my way
all along, and will be to the end.”</p>

<p class='c001'>One of the shafts was broken, and there ensued delay
whilst it was being patched up with rope. Then, when
they were able to pursue their career, Pasco was constrained
to drive more carefully and less rapidly. Night was coming
on as they neared Newton Abbot.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I’ll tell you what it is,” said Pasco;  “I’m uncommon
hungry, and I’ll just go into the first public-house and have
a mouthful of something, and you shall do the same. The
cob is a bit shaken with that spill, and I’ll have the shaft
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>fastened up firmer before we proceed. What say you?
Here’s the ‘Crown and Anchor.’ How the place is
changed. Ah, ha! It is insured at the same office as I
am. Why—bless my life!—the old inn was a ramshackle
sort of a place.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Pepperill descended from his trap, and gave instructions
to the ostler what he was to do to the broken shaft. “I’ll
pay you well if you do your work,” said he. Then to
Bramber, “Come in! Cold meat and bread-and-cheese,
and a glass of ale. We need refreshment, and the house
looks as if it could provide it. Don’t be concerned about
the cost. I don’t suppose you are overflush with cash.
I’ll  pay—you are my guest.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Pasco’s self-conceit was a constant spring of energy in
him. Dashed his spirits might be by disaster, but he
speedily recovered his buoyancy, owing to this characteristic
element in his nature. It is said that the fertility of Manitoba
is due to the fact that below the surface the soil is frozen
hard in winter, and during the summer the warmth of the
sun penetrating ever farther thaws the ice, and thus water
incessantly wells up, nourishing and moistening the roots
of the corn. There was a perennial body of self-esteem
deep in the heart of Pasco Pepperill, and this fed and
sustained in vigorous growth a harvest of generosity in
dealing with his inferiors, of liberality towards the poor, of
display in his mercantile transactions, that imposed on the
public and made it suppose that he was prosperous in his
many affairs.</p>

<p class='c001'>The landlord came to the door.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>“How do you do, Mr. Pepperill?—glad to see you.
You do not often favour me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well—no. If I come this way I mostly stop at
the Golden Sun. You see, you are rather near my
home.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I hope this, though the first visit, is not the
last!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I daresay not. What brings me now is an accident.
Can you let us have some supper?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Certainly. What would you like—cold beef, cold
mutton, or chops and potatoes?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You have a supply of good things.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am obliged to have. I get plenty of custom
now.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What! more than of old?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, double, since I have rebuilt my house.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I see. The place is completely changed. You had
but a poor sort of a tavern.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes; and  now”—the landlord looked round, smiled,
and put his hands into his waistband—"middling good,
I think."</p>

<p class='c001'>“Uncommon,” said Pasco. “I suppose it is the better
look of the house that has brought better custom.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That’s just it. I had only common wayfarers  before—mostly
tramps. Now—the better sort altogether. Where
I turned over a penny before, I turn over a shilling
now.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“So you rebuilt your public-house to get better
business?”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>“Well, you see, I couldn’t help myself. The old place
caught fire and burnt down.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And it did not ruin you?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Dear me, no. I was insured.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“So—that set you on your legs again?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It was the making of me, was that fire.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“How long had you been insured before you were burnt
out?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, now, that is the curious part of the story,” said
the landlord; “hardly a week.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And how did your place catch fire?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There was a tramp. I refused to take him in, as he
had no money. That was the best stroke of business I
ever did in my life. He hid himself in a sort o’ lean-to
there was over the pigs’ houses, joined on to the house,
and in it was straw. I reckon he went to sleep there
with his pipe alight, and he set fire to the place.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Was he burnt?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No; he got away all right; but the straw set fire to
the rafters, and they ran into the wall. It was a poor old
wall, with no mortar in it, and the rafters came in just
under those of the upstairs chambers, so that when the
roof of the linhay was afire, it set the house in a blaze too.
That was how it all came about.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And a good job it was for you!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It was the making of me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Pasco was silent through the meal. He seemed hardly
to taste what he was eating. He gulped down his food
and drank copiously.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>Bramber was relieved when he left. He was afraid
Pepperill would drink more than he could bear. At the
entrance to the village he left the cart, and thanked Pasco
for the lift.</p>

<p class='c001'>Pepperill drove on to Coombe Cellars.</p>

<p class='c001'>As he came up, he saw his wife standing at the door
with a light in her hand.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Pasco, is that you?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Who else?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“So, you are home at last. There has been the coal
merchant here; he swears he will bring you no more, and
that, unless you pay up this month, he will set the lawyers
on you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Pepperill flung himself from his cart.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Heavens!” said he, looking sullenly at his stores; “if
they would but burn!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Burn—what burn?” asked Mrs. Pepperill sharply.
“Do you think you cannot leave the house for a day but
some mischief must come on it? As if I were not to be
trusted, and everything lay with you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I did not mean that, Zerah.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then what did you mean?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I meant that it might have got me out of difficulties.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What might?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Pasco did not answer.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I should like to know how, if the store were to be
burnt, any good would come of that. You’ve been
drinking, Pasco.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>“I’m insured,” said he in a low tone.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, it has come to that, has it? Heaven help
us!”</p>

<p class='c001'>The woman beat her face with her open palms, turned,
and went within.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XX <br /><span class='small'>A FACE IN THE WATER</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c010'>Kate Quarm was very happy on the moor. Her
father had fetched her from Ashburton, and had
lodged her in a cottage near Dart-meet, the point where the
East and West Darts, rushing foaming from the moors,
dancing over boulders, breaking over granite floors, plunging
under tufts of golden gorse, and through brakes of
osmund and male fern, reach each other and meet in one
silver flood.</p>

<p class='c001'>The weather was fine, though cold, that is to say, the
sun was hot, but a keen east wind blew. But then this is
one of the charms of the moor, that shelter can always be
found from the wind. A mighty bank of mountains rose
as a wall against the east, and in its dingles and dells,
dense with gorse, now in blaze of flower, the air was warm,
and balmy, and still.</p>

<p class='c001'>At Coombe Cellars Kate had been kept continually
employed; her aunt, an active woman, gave the child no
rest. If she saw her flag in her work, Zerah goaded her
with reproach to fresh activity; she was, moreover, never
accorded a word of encouragement. Zerah accepted her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>work as a matter of course; if it was well done, that was
but as it ought to be; everything that fell short of well,
was occasion for a scolding. Kate’s nature was one that
needed repose from manual and sordid labour, for her
mind desired to be active, and craved for freedom in which
to expand, and for liberty to seek material on which to
feed. This Zerah did not understand; with any other
activity, except that of the body in scrubbing and rubbing,
in cooking and baking, she had no sympathy; she entertained
a positive aversion for books. She had no eye for
beauty, no ear for melody, no heart for poetry.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now Kate had leisure—now for the first time in her life
in which her soul could draw its tender wings out of its
case and flutter them in freedom. She felt much as must
the May-fly when it breaks from its chrysalis.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was, moreover, a joy to think that her father had
considered her so far as to require her to be sent to the
moor to recover. He usually paid little heed to Kitty, and
now her heart was warm with gratitude because he had
given her that very thing of all others which she most
desired—rest in the presence of nature awakening under
a spring sun.</p>

<p class='c001'>Kate had another source of pleasure with her. As
Walter Bramber parted from her at Ashburton, he put a
little book into her hand, and said—</p>

<p class='c001'>“I will lend it you. I know you will value it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The book was Wordsworth’s poems.</p>

<p class='c001'>As she sat beside her father in the gig, she had her hand
on the volume all the while, and her heart swelled with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>excitement and eagerness to read it. At night she hugged
the book to her bosom, and fell asleep with both hands
clasped over it. She could hardly endure that night
should, with its darkness, deny her the happiness of reading.
She woke early, and in the breaking daylight devoured
the pages. As she read, she laughed and cried—laughed
and cried with sheer delight. She had a book to read;
and such a book!</p>

<p class='c001'>This happy girl turned first to the verses on the daffodils
that she had learned by heart, to make quite certain that
she had all, that not a line had been missed, not a word
got awry. Then she looked at the little poems on the
celandine, and never did a famished child devour a meal
with greater avidity than did Kate read and master these
verses. There was much in Wordsworth that she could
not understand, but the fact that she encountered passages
that were unintelligible to her were of advantage, her clear
intellect striking on these hard portions threw out sparks—ideas
that had light in them. The book not only nourished
her mind, but proved educative to her imagination.</p>

<p class='c001'>Kate was at first overwhelmed with the flood of happiness
that rolled over her. Her eyes could not satiate themselves
with the beauty of the moorland scenery. She ran among
the rocks, she dived into the coombs, she stepped on the
boulders over the water, she watched the workmen engaged
in felling trees.</p>

<p class='c001'>Spring flowers peeped from behind rocks, bog plants
peered out of the morasses. Kate began collecting. She
dried the flowers between the leaves of her Prayer-book.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>She scrambled among the towering rocks that overhung
the Dart below the meeting of the waters, and watched the
shadows and lights travel over the vast tract of moorland
that stretched away as far as the eye could see in every
direction but the east, where the river rolled out of its
mountain cradle into a lap of the richest woodland. Sometimes
the beauty of the scenery, the variety of landscape,
were too much for her; she sought change and repose by
creeping among the rocks and drawing the book from her
bosom.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet she could not read for long. The verses exacted
close attention, and a flash of passing sun, or impatience at
some passage she could not comprehend, made her close
the volume and recommence her rambles. The exhilarating
air, the brilliancy of the light, the complete change from the
mild and languid atmosphere in the Teign estuary told on
Kate’s spirits and looks. Her cheeks gathered roundness
and colour, and her tread acquired elasticity. Her spirits
were light; they found vent occasionally in racing the cloud
shadows over a smooth hillside.</p>

<p class='c001'>One day, with her lap full of moss of every rainbow hue,
she came upon the rector of Coombe-in-Teignhead, painting.</p>

<p class='c001'>At her exclamation he turned, recognised her, and smiled.</p>

<p class='c001'>“So—I thought I must soon see you,” he said. “My
dear little Kitty, I come with messages for you and kind
inquiries.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“From whom—from uncle and aunt?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No; not from them. The schoolmaster, Mr. Bramber,
when he heard whither I was coming, begged me to see you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>and ascertain how you were, and whether you liked the
book he lent you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, sir, I read it every day! I know several pieces by
heart.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That you are well, I see. I never saw you with such a
glow of health and happiness in your bonnie face before.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Thank you, sir. And will you see him soon?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Whom? Bramber?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, sir,” answered Kate, the glow in her face deepening.
“And will you say that I have been picking the
flowers as they come out, and I can find them, and that I
do want to know what they are called? God brought the
beasts to Adam to name them, and I do not think Adam
can have been happy with the beasts till he had given each
a name. It is so with me and the flowers. I see them,
and I love them; but I don’t feel content till I can tell
what each is called. Mr. Bramber can name them all.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You have made a collection?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, I have dried them in my Prayer-book. They are
waiting for Mr. Bramber to name. But”—Kate  drew
back—"I am in your way, sir; you are painting the old
bridge."</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes; but you can sit down there if you like, and will
not disturb me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“May I? Oh, I shall be pleased.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Kate placed herself on a lichen-covered rock on one side,
at a little distance from the water.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have left my few sheep for a couple of days,” said Mr.
Fielding apologetically, partly to Kate, mostly to himself;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>“but I do not think I have done wrong. Moses went up
into the Mount, and came back to his people with his face
shining. I do not know, but it seems to me that when I
have been here aloft, speaking with nature and nature’s God,
face to face, that I can go back and carry with me some of
the brightness and the freshness and the fragrance of the
mountain. I may be wrong, finding an excuse for myself,
because I love to come here.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Please, sir,” said Kate, “the Great Master of all dismissed
the multitude and went up into the mountain
apart.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, child, yes,” answered the rector, painting as he
talked; “and when He came down, He walked on the
stormy waves. And I—His humble follower—I think I
can tread on the troubles and cares of life erect, and not
be swallowed up after I have been here.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I do not know how I shall bear to go back to Coombe
Cellars,” said Kate sadly.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You will go back braced to do your work. We cannot
always play, Kitty dear. You know the fable of the bow.
It was relaxed only that it might be the better weapon when
restrung. Besides, when you return you will have pleasure.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I shall think about my delightful holiday.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes; and learn the names of the flowers you have dried
in your Prayer-book,” said Mr. Fielding, with a twinkle in
the corner of his eye.</p>

<p class='c001'>Kate dropped her head in confusion, but looked up again
and said frankly, “Yes, that will be pleasant; and I can
tell where each grew and how I found it.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>“Tell whom—your aunt?” A faint crease in the old
man’s cheek showed he was smiling.</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, sir! she won’t care. I shall tell Mr. Bramber, if I
have the chance.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Kitty, I get very downhearted over my work sometimes.
Then I come up here, and gather courage and strength,
and—and trust, Kitty. You will return to Coombe Cellars
strengthened and nerved to do your duty well and hopefully.
Remember, it was kind of your aunt to let you come. She
has to drudge hard whilst you are absent, but she does it
because you have been ill and need relaxation in mind and
invigoration of body. She does it, Kitty, because she <em>loves</em>
you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, sir!” Kate coloured with astonishment and with
a twinge of pain at her heart.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, dear little friend, she loves you. She is not a
demonstrative person. She is a clear-headed, practical
woman. She has had a hard life, and much to try her, and
to give her a cold and perhaps repellent manner. Nevertheless,
her heart is sound and warm. When you were ill
I spoke with her. I saw how anxious she was for your
welfare. I saw into her heart, and I read love there.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Kate trembled, and let the mosses fall from her lap and
strew themselves about her feet. The tears came into her
eyes.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, sir, I should like to go home at once and do
everything I can for her! I did not think she really cared
for me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You do not return till your father decides that you are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>to go back to work. Then, you will return with a good
courage, as I said.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“With all my heart!” answered Kate fervently, and her
face brightened as though the sun shone on it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Afraid of disturbing the old rector at his painting, Kate
withdrew. She was happy at heart. What he had said
had done her good. She had shrunk from the thought of
return to the humdrum of her usual life, but Mr. Fielding
had given her a motive for facing work with cheerfulness.
It was a delight to her to think that her aunt loved her.
She loved her aunt. Daily association with Zerah had
made her cling to the hard, captious woman; she had had
no one else to love, and the young heart must love someone.</p>

<p class='c001'>Kate delighted to lie by the river, or lie on a rock in it,
and look down into its pellucid pools, or at the flowing
crystal where it broke between the stones. She was accustomed
to the muddy estuary, and though the sea-water
when it flowed was clear, it had none of the perfect transparency
of this spring water near its source. The sea
sweeping up the creek was as bottle-green glass, but this
was liquid crystal itself, without colour of any sort, and
through it everything in the depths was visible as though
no medium intervened.</p>

<p class='c001'>Kate could look at the shining pebbles, at the waving
water-weed, at the darting fish. When she had left Mr.
Fielding, she went to one of her favourite haunts beside the
Dart, where it brawled over a cataract of rocks and then
spread into a pool still as glass.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now she saw what puzzled her, and set her active brain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>questioning the reason. As she looked into the water, she
could see no reflection of her own face; the light sky was
mirrored, and where the shadow of her head came, she
could see far more distinctly to the bottom of the pool than
elsewhere. Indeed, when a fish darted past she could discern
its fins and scales, but when it passed beyond her
shadow, its form became indistinct.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then Kate rose on her elbows, and as she did this the
sun caught her cheek and nose, and cheek and nose were
at once reflected in the water, and where the reflection
came, there the water was less transparent to her eyes.</p>

<p class='c001'>To observe was to rouse in the girl’s mind a desire to
find an explanation for the very simple phenomenon that
puzzled her.</p>

<p class='c001'>She was thus engaged, raising her face, then a hand, so
as to be now sunlit, then to intercept the light, and see
what the effect was on the water, when she was startled to
observe in the liquid mirror the reflection of a second face
looking down from above. The sun was on it, in the
eyes, and they glittered up at her from below.</p>

<p class='c001'>With an exclamation of alarm, she turned and saw a man
standing above her.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXI <br /><span class='small'>AN OFFER</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c010'>Kate rose to a sitting posture, and drew her feet
under her, rested one hand on the rock, and with
the other screened her eyes from the glare of the sun, to
observe the intruder on her solitude.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then she recognised Roger Redmore. He was without
his coat, an axe over one shoulder. In his right hand he
held a tuft of cotton grass dug up by the roots.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I knowed as you wor here,” said he, “but I dursn’t
speak before others, lest they should find me out who I
wor.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Are you living here, Roger?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I be working here at the felling Brimpts oaks. You
see, your fayther, he’s so little at Coombe that he don’t
know me, and I thought I might get money by working
here. And I want you to do a little job for me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What is it, Roger?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There’s two jobs. First, do y’ see this here root o’
white shiny grass? Well, I want y’ to take it to Coombe
and to set it on my little maid’s grave. Stick the roots in.
It may grow and it mayn’t. Hereabouts it groweth mostly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>in wet land. But anyhows by it I shall know where the
little maid lies when I come back to Coombe.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You are returning, Roger?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not by day. I reckon some night I shall be back just
for an hour or so, and I want, when I does come, to go to
the churchyard and find out at once where my darlin’
lieth. If it be moonlight, or dimmets (twilight), and I see
the little silver tuft glitter above her head, then I shall
know where her be. I can’t go wi’ my wife; that would
be tellin’ folks I wor home agin. I mun go by myself.
Whereabouts now have they put her?”</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='corr29.22'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='By'>“By</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_29.22'><ins class='correction' title='By'>“By</ins></a></span> the wall where the cedar is, on the east side.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There’ll niver be no headstone there,” observed
Redmore, “but what o’ that? When once I know where
her lieth, sure but I’ll put a fresh new tuft of silver tassels
as oft as the old ones die, and I reckon they’ll die, not
being in a wet place. My little maid’s grave won’t be wet
save wi’ her father and mother’s tears, and her fayther he
can’t be there but on the sly, and now and then.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I will do it for you gladly,” said Kate. “When do
you think you will be home?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Home!” repeated Roger; “I’ve no home—not like to
have. My wife and my little ones, wherever they be, that’s
all the world to me, and I cannot see them but at night,
and very chancy, when I don’t think nobody’s about. And
t’other thing be this.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Roger put his hand into his pocket and drew forth
some coin, and gave it to the girl.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Take this to my old woman. I’ve earned wi’ my work
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>a bit o’ money, and here is what I can send her. Tell her
to leave the door ajar. I may come any night; but,” he
paused, “I reckon they’ve turned her out o’ house and
home now.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not yet, Roger,” answered Kate. “Mr. Pooke has
not insisted on her leaving at quarter-day, but I believe he
has a fresh workman coming to him in a week, and then
she will have to leave.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And where will she go? Will they drive her into the
street?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I really do not know; but”—she considered and said
timidly, “I have had it on my heart, but have been afraid
to speak of it as yet to my father. There is his cottage,
never or hardly ever occupied. Now I will take courage,
and beg him to let your wife go into it till something can
be settled; but you must keep out of danger, and you are
not safe here.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I cannot go far till my wife and little ones are secure
and have a home. Here no one know’th me, the other
woodcutters are all men from the moor. There was but
your father, and he did not recognise me when I axed him
to take me on at felling the timber.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I will entreat him to allow your wife and children to
go into his house till something can be done for them.
You will have to escape into another part of the country.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ay, I will go. If I were took, it would go bad with us
all, and there’d be the shame on my little ones—that their
father wor hanged. They’d never shake it off.” Then he
touched Kate on the head. “My hand be but a wicked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>un. It hev set fire to a rick, but it be the hand o’ a hunted
man, as be nigh crushed with sorrows, as was druv to
wickedness thro’ his sufferin’s, and hev bitter repented it
since, and swears he’ll niver do it agin, so help me God!”
He raised his hand solemnly to heaven. “That’s one
thing I ha’ larned, as doin’ wrong niver brings matters right.
There wor just that gettin’ drunk. Then there wor the
cheek to Farmer Pooke. Then my heart were all wormwood;
and when my little maid died, I thought it wor his
doin’; and so in a way it wor, for I’d no work and no
wage, and us was just about starvin’, and I did that deed
o’ fire. It’s kindled a fire in here”—he touched his heart—"that
nothink can quench. The Lord ha’ pity on me. I
don’t know as I’d ha’ come to this mind but for you, little
Kitty Alone, as was pitiful to me when I were bound and
like to be given over to gaol, and you let me go, and fed
me wi’ crumbs out o’ your hand; and now you will find
a house for my dear ones." He laid his hand on her head
again. “Mebbe the Lord’ll hear a sinful thief o’ a man,
and I ax His blessin’ on thee; an’ if I can iver do anything
to show you I’m thankful, I will. Amen.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Hah!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Roger. Redmore started. He was caught by a hand in
his collar-band.</p>

<p class='c001'>Kate sprang to her feet. Her uncle, Pasco Pepperill,
was there. He had come up from behind unobserved, and
had laid hold of the incendiary.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have you, you burning vagabond!” shouted he; “and
by heaven! I’ll hand you over to the constables, and see you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>hanged, as you deserve. Kate, run away—away at
once!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, uncle, do not be cruel! Let him go.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You mind your business,” answered Pasco sharply.
“It’s my belief you let him escape after Jan Pooke had
bound him in the boat. Jan left you in charge, and Roger
slipped away then.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But think, uncle, of his poor wife and children.”</p>

<p class='c001'>With a sudden wrench Roger freed himself, and then,
standing back with brandished axe, he said—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Touch me, and I’ll split your head.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Get away from here,” ordered Pasco, turning to his
niece; “and as for you, Redmore, I want a word. You
know very well that if I give the hue and cry you will be
caught, even though now you have slipped from me.
Lower your hatchet; I’m not going to hurt you if you be
reasonable; but wait till that girl is out of earshot.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Pepperill put his hands into his pockets and watched
Kate as she withdrew. Roger assumed an attitude of
wariness. He was ready at a moment’s notice to defend
himself with his axe, or to take to flight.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Look here,” said Pasco, satisfied that he could not be
overheard, “it seems to me that you, with your head
almost in the noose, have done a wonderful silly thing to
stay so near the scene of your crime.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I’d my reasons as is not for you to know,” answered
Redmore surlily. “I’m sure you don’t consarn yourself
for me and mine so as to care.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There you are mistaken,” said Pasco. “I don’t mean
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>to say that I am deeply interested in you, but I don’t
intend, unless driven to it, to take any steps to get you
acquainted with Jack Ketch.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I can defend myself pretty well, suppose you do.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I’m not the fool to risk my head in another man’s
quarrel.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And I can take to my heels and find a hiding-place
anywhere on these moors.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ay, and a starving-place where your bones will rot.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What have you to say to me?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Redmore spoke surlily. Now that his whereabouts was
discovered, it would be needful for him to shift his place of
refuge.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I suppose you don’t deny setting fire to Farmer Pooke’s
rick?” said Pasco.</p>

<p class='c001'>Roger shrugged his shoulders and jerked his head.</p>

<p class='c001'>“How did you do it? smoking a pipe under the tree
when drunk?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, it warn’t.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“How was it, then?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I warn’t drunk, niver but that once, and that wor just
because o’ Jackson’s ‘Tee-dum.’ I’ve a bit of a orgin in
zingin’, and the innkeeper he wor terrible longing to have
me in the choir. So he got me in, and they tried to teach
me the tenor part o’ Jackson’s ‘Tee-dum,’ and I cu’dn’t
maister it noways; and they stood me liquor, and I tried,
and I cu’d do naught wi’ it. You see t’other parts went
curling up and about, and bothered me. If they’d a’
stopped and let me zing alone, I cu’d ha’ done it. Then I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>went out into the open air, and it wor cold and frosty, and
somehow I got mazed wi’ the drink and the ‘Tee-dum’
together, and I rinned agin my maister, Farmer Pooke, and
I reckon I zed what I ort not, and he turned me off. That
wor it. I niver did it avor, and I’ll niver do it agin. Save
and presarve me from liquor and Jackson’s ‘Tee-dum’!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Never mind about that. So you didn’t fire the rick
with your pipe?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, I didn’t. If it had niver been for Jackson’s
‘Tee-dum,’ I’d not now be in risk of bein’ hanged.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Of course it was Jackson did it all,” sneered Pasco.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I don’t mean to say that. It wor the beginning on it.
I were throwed out o’ work, and were starvin’, and my
little maid, her died, and then I wor like a mazed chap,
and I ran out wi’ the cann’l, and so I did it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, with the candle?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It wor a rushlight.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I’ve heard of barns and storehouses being set fire to by
men going into them to sleep, and lighting their pipes.
There was the landlord of the Crown and Anchor at
Newton. He had a miserable sort of a house, but a tramp
got in one night”—</p>

<p class='c001'>“What, into his house?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, into a linhay over the pigstye, and slept there, or
went there to sleep, and there was straw in the loft, and in
smoking his pipe he managed to set fire to the straw, and
then the whole public-house was in a blaze and burnt
down.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I’ve heard of that. Nobody knows what became o’ the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>tramp. There wor roast pig found in the ashes, and
whether roast tramp nobody cared to inquire.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The inn has been rebuilt. They call it a hotel now.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I daresay they does.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The insurance money did that.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I s’pose so. Lucky the house wor insured. I wish
Varmer Pooke ’ad been.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You do?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I reckon I does. I’m sorry for what I did when I wor
in a b’ilin’ blue rage. Now I can’t get over it noways, and
you may tell’n so.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why, that fire was the making of the landlord. He
feels no ill-will against the tramp. What are you going to
do with yourself now?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I suppose you will want to see your wife again?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I s’pose I shall.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“For that you will return to Coombe?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“In coorse I must.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“At night—lest you should be seen?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ay—to be sure.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You will lurk about—be in hiding. I’ll tell you what,
I’m your good friend. I will do you no harm. I’ll just
leave the door of my stores open—unhasped; and if you
want to creep in, there’s a lot of wool and other things
there, you can be warm there, Roger, warm in the
wool.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Thanky’, sir. You’ll not peach?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And if—if you like a pipe—well”—</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>“No, Mr. Pepperill, I won’t do you that ill turn if you’re
so good to me—and the little maid, Kitty, too.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, I did not mean that. I can’t say but if a spark
chanced to fall among the wool, and the whole was to
blaze away, I should be sorry. I can’t say that I should be
troubled, any more than was the landlord at Newton when
the tramp set fire to his linhay over the pigs.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Redmore said nothing. Pepperill spoke slowly, and did
not look the man in the face as he spoke.</p>

<p class='c001'>“If that chance was to happen to me as happened to
the man at Newton, it might, there’s no saying, be a saving
of me from a great misfortune, and—I shouldn’t mind
being a liberal friend, and helping you out of the country.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That is what you mean, is it?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It might be a convenience to both of us.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“’Tis a wonderful world,” exclaimed Redmore, “when
the biggest rascals go free, and one of them be you! A
little rascal like me, who’s sorry that ever he done wrong,
is chivied like a mad dog.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well—what do you say?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You’re a rascal and I despise you,” cried Roger, and
turned to go.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Will you have me as your friend or your enemy?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Your enemy rather than friend on them terms.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then I’ll hang you!” exclaimed Pasco, and set off
running in the direction of Brimpts.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXII <br /><span class='small'>A RACE FOR LIFE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c010'>Kate had walked away without a thought of attempting
to gather the subject of her uncle’s conversation
with Redmore. She resolved at once to seek her father
and obtain from him permission to house the unfortunate
wife with her children in his cottage. She had been told
that he had gone to a farm lying somewhat to the right of
the Ashburton road, near the prominent and stately rock
citadel of Sharpitor. She therefore ascended the long, steep
hill, up which scrambles the high road from Dart-meet.</p>

<p class='c001'>Halfway up the ascent is an oblong mass of granite,
lying in the moor, which goes by the name of the Coffin
Stone, because on it coffins are rested by those who are
bearing a corpse to its lasting resting-place in the distant
churchyards of Buckland or Ashburton. Kate had reached
this stone, and was panting for breath, when she heard
shouts and cries in the valley she was leaving, and, leaping
upon the Coffin Stone, she saw a swarm of men on the
opposite bank of the Dart—the Brimpts side—running in
the direction of the bridge, headed by her uncle, who was
then levelling a gun he carried.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>From her elevation she could not only see but hear
everything.</p>

<p class='c001'>“An incendiary! He set fire to a stack. A pound to
any man who takes him, alive or dead!” shouted Pasco,
and to Kate every word was audible. Then she saw the
flash of the gun, and a little later heard the report. The
shot had missed, for her uncle urged on the men to run
and not let the scoundrel escape, and he himself lagged
behind to reload his barrel.</p>

<p class='c001'>She looked for the fugitive, but was able to see him for
one moment only, as he leaped a ruinous fence in his flight
down stream.</p>

<p class='c001'>Why was he taking that direction? Because the way
into the fastnesses of the moorland was closed to him by
his pursuers. He could not run up the hill that Kate
ascended, as he would be exposed throughout, without the
smallest cover, to the gun of Pepperill. Though a course
down the river led ultimately into inhabited land, yet between
the moor and population lay the great woodland
belt of Buckland and Holme Chase, where the river wound
its way in sweeps among dense forest and rock, and where
Redmore knew he could hide with the greatest ease. But
before he could be in the woodland he had a long stretch
of moor to traverse, where there was no road, at best a
fisherman’s track, among rocks scattered in confusion,
among heather and furze bushes, with here and there sloe
and thorn trees and an occasional “witch beam” or rowan
growing out of the rocks. Almost immediately after the
junction of the East with the West Dart, the united stream
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>doubles round Sharpitor, that shoots high above it on one
side, and under the ridges of Benjietor on the other side,
in whose lap grows a little copse, and which, from its crags
to the water’s edge, is green with bracken in summer,
but at this period was russet with withered leaves.
Thence smoke rose—some boys had ignited the gorse,
and the flames ran among the withered ferns and the fallen
oak-leaves, and blackened and burnt the copse.</p>

<p class='c001'>Kate hastened on her way. She knew that on reaching
the head of the ridge a short distance intervened between
the road and the precipices of Sharpitor that overhung the
ravine. Thence she could see all that followed—if Roger
Redmore succeeded in turning the moorland spur round
which the river foamed.</p>

<p class='c001'>Hot, trembling, and breathless, Kate ran, then halted to
gasp, then ran on, and did not rest for more than a minute
till she had reached the vantage-point on the rocks, and
looked down into a wondrous ravine of river, granite
boulder, and glaring golden furze, and with the blue smoke
of the smouldering fern forming a haze that hung in its
depths, but which rose in places above the rocky crests of
the moor and showed brown against the luminous sky.</p>

<p class='c001'>Kate ensconced herself among the piles of granite, with
a “clatter,” as it is locally termed, at her feet, a mass of
rocky ruin, composed of granite, in fragments of every size
and in various conditions of disintegration.</p>

<p class='c001'>She saw Redmore as he doubled the foot of the mountain,
and for awhile had the advantage of being invisible
to his pursuers, and safe from the gun of Pepperill. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>stood on a great rock half-way out of the water, and looked
about him. He was resolving what to do, whether to continue
his course down stream, or to endeavour to conceal
himself at once. The fire and smoke on the farther side
in the bosom of Benjietor made it impossible for him to
secrete himself there—every lurking-place was scorched or
menaced by the flames. The slope of Sharpitor on his left,
though strewn with the wreckage of the crags above, offered
no safe refuge; it was exposed to full light, without any
bushes in it other than the whortle and heather. Roger
did not take long to make up his mind; he pursued his
course down the river, now wading, then scrambling over
stones, then leaping from rock to rock, and then again
flying over a tract of smooth turf. Occasionally the wind,
playing with the smoke, carried a curl of it across the river,
and drew it out and shook it as a veil, obscuring Redmore
from the eyes of Kate, who watched him in panting unrest,
and with prayers for his safety welling up in her heart.
Then shouts—the men who hunted him had rounded the
flank of Shapitor, and had caught sight of the man they
were endeavouring to catch. One fellow, with very long
legs, familiar with the ground, accustomed all his life to
the moor, was making great way, and bade fair to catch
Roger.</p>

<p class='c001'>Redmore looked behind him. He had cast away his
axe, and was therefore unarmed, but was lightened for the
race.</p>

<p class='c001'>“A sovereign to the man who catches him!” yelled
Pepperill. “Knock him down, brain him!”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>Then one man heaved a stone, picked out of the river,
and threw it. A vain attempt. He was not within reach
of Redmore; but in a pursuit, none can quite consider
what is possible, and measure distances with nicety, without
much greater coolness than is possessed by men running
and leaping over difficult ground. The long-legged
man kept forging ahead, with his elbows close to his sides;
he had distanced the rest. He was fleet of foot, he sprang
from stone to stone without pausing to consider, and
without ever missing his footing. Roger advanced slowly:
he was unaccustomed to such difficult ground; sometimes
he fell; he floundered into the river up to his armpits and
scrambled out with difficulty. His pursuer never got into
the water. The man had not merely long legs, he had a
long nose and protruding eyes, and as he ran, with his
elbows back, he held his forefingers extended, the rest
folded. Every stride brought him nearer to Redmore, and
Roger, who had just scrambled upon a rock in the river,
saw that he must be overtaken, and he prepared for the
inevitable struggle.</p>

<p class='c001'>Kate, leaning forward in her eagerness, at this moment
displaced a large block, that slid down, turned on its edge
and rolled, then leaped, then bounded high into the air,
crashed down on another rock, and from it leaped again in
its headlong course.</p>

<p class='c001'>The girl held her breath. It seemed as though the
rock must strike the running pursuer, and if it struck him
it would inevitably be his death. The rattle of displaced
stones, the crash of the block as it struck, the cries of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>those behind, who saw the danger, arrested the long-legged
man. He halted, and looked up and around, and at that
moment the stone whizzed past and plunged into the river.
Kate saw in a moment the advantage thus gained, and in
palpitating haste threw down every stone she could reach
or tilt over from its resting-place, where nicely balanced,
thus sending a succession of volleys of leaping, whistling
stones across the path, between the pursued and the pursuers.</p>

<p class='c001'>She heard shouts and execrations from those who were
coming up, and who stood still, not daring to continue their
course, and run the risk of having their brains beaten out
by one of the falling stones. She regarded them not. Her
one idea was to save Roger. She could see that the man
for whom she acted had recognised her intervention, and
continued his flight. She could see that the pursuers were
stationary, uncertain what to do.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then her uncle again raised his gun. Kate put her hands
to her mouth and called to Roger, who looked over his
shoulder, and dropped behind a stone just as the gun was
discharged.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then he picked himself up once more and ran on. Kate
dared not desist. She continued to send block after block
rolling. Some were shattered in their descent, and resolved
themselves into a cloud of whizzing projectiles. Some in
striking the soil set a mass of rubble in motion that shot
down and threw up a cloud of dust.</p>

<p class='c001'>She was hot, weary, her hands wounded. But the consciousness
of success strung her to renewed exertion.
Pasco Pepperill called the party in pursuit together. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>shouted up the height to the girl. Who it was there engaged
in dislodging stones he couldn’t discern, for Kate kept herself
concealed as far as possible, and the confusion of the
granite rocks thrown into heaps and dislocated, served to
disguise the presence of anyone among them. He threatened,
but threatened in vain; Kate did not stay her hand to give
time to listen to what he cried.</p>

<p class='c001'>After a brief consultation, as the avalanche did not decrease,
the party resolved to cross the river and continue
the pursuit down it on the farther side, through the smoke
and over the ashes of the conflagration. By this means
Roger Redmore could be kept in sight, and possibly it
would be more easy to run over the charred soil among
bushes reduced to ash. Moreover, few, if any, of the stones
dislodged by Kate had sufficient weight and velocity to carry
them to the farther side of the river.</p>

<p class='c001'>Accordingly, the party began to step on the rocks that
projected from the water, or to wade, so as to reach the
farther side, Pepperill lingering behind reloading his gun,
and keeping his eye on the fugitive. Then a sudden idea
struck him, and, calling to the men to proceed as they had
proposed, he started to climb the steep tide of Sharpitor, at
a point where not menaced by the falling stones, judging
that by this means he would dislodge the person who had
come to the assistance of the fugitive, and at the same time
be able to follow the flight of the latter with his eye better
than below, and to obtain a more leisurely shot at him when
a suitable occasion offered, as his poising himself on a rock,
or halting to resolve on his course.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>Kate desisted from sending down volleys of stones, till
the occasion should arise again. She watched the flight of
Roger, and perceived that he was aiming at a coppice which
was in a fold of the hills undiscernible by those on the
farther side of the river; by means of this coppice, if he
could reach it, Roger would be able to effect his escape.</p>

<p class='c001'>In three minutes he was safe; then Kate drew a long
breath. At the same moment she was touched on the
shoulder, and, looking round, saw her father.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What’s all this about? What’s this shouting and firing
of guns?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, father, I hope I have not done wrong! Uncle and
all the men are after Roger Redmore.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Who is he?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The man who burnt Mr. Pooke’s ricks, and he has been
working for you here—and uncle recognised him, and sent
the men to take him, and he ran away, and I have helped
him.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes; by rolling down rocks.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Jason burst into a fit of laughter. “Come, that is fine.
You and I, Kitty, aiders and abettors of an incendiary. Is
he clear off now?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes; but here comes uncle up the steep side.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Jason hobbled to the edge of the rock, and, leaning over
called, “Halloo, Pasco! Here we are waiting for you—Kitty
Alone and I.”</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c010'>“It is you—you two!” exclaimed Pepperill, as he reached
the summit. He gasped the words; he could not
shout, so short of breath was he. His face with heat was
purple as a blackberry. “What’s the meaning of this?”
He held to a projection of granite, and panted. “Interfering
with law—protecting a scoundrel.” He paused to
wipe his face. “A malefactor—a criminal—guilty”—again
gasped like a fish out of water—"guilty of incendiarism, of
arson, of felony!"</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why, Pasco, you’re hot. Keep cool, old boy,” said
Jason, laughing. “Who has created you constable, or sheriff
of the county, that you are so anxious to apprehend rogues?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Rogues? rogues? Only rogues assist rogues in escaping
the reward of their deeds.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Is there a warrant out for his apprehension?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then what on earth makes you put yourself in a heat
and commotion to catch him?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Pasco mopped his brow, and, tearing up some ferns, dry
though they were, proceeded to fan his face.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>“Why? Do you ask? For the public security, of course.
And now”—again he puffed—"now I can’t talk; my wind
is gone."</p>

<p class='c001'>Pepperill looked into the ravine. He could see that the
men on the farther side of the stream were at a nonplus.
The fugitive had escaped them, had dived out of their sight
into the coppice-wood, and they knew that pursuit was in
vain. He turned sharply on his brother-in-law.</p>

<p class='c001'>“This is your doing—you and Kate. First you give him
work, and then you let him escape. He who helps a felon
is a felon himself.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“My dear Pasco,” said Jason Quarm, laughing, “what
makes you so fiery in this matter?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Fiery? of course I’m fiery. And look there, Jason!
There are the workmen, a dozen of them, doing nothing,
and we shall have to pay their wages for a half day, and
nothing to show for it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Whose fault is that? You sent them from their
tasks.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, to catch a villain.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Which was no concern of yours.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is a concern of mine, and of every honest man. How
can one be safe with such a malefactor at large? I have
my house, my stores; I shall not be able to sleep at night
with ease, knowing that this fellow is at large. If anything
happens, I shall come on you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You’ll get nothing from me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That is the worst; I know it. Why did you help the
man to escape? No one is safe—no one. And I, least
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>of all; for now he regards me as his enemy. He has
sworn vengeance; he may come on me and cut my
throat.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not much throat to be cut, Pasco.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There is my money-box”—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Box, not money.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He may set fire to my house—my barns—burn me and
my wife—your sister—Kitty—your daughter. Don’t you
care for that?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am not afraid. If you went after him, and have
angered him, well, we helped him, as you suppose, and have
won his good-will.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“As I know. Have I not found you here? Who else
could have rolled down the rocks? Show me your hands.
There, I said so!—there is blood on Kate’s hands; they
are cut and bruised. She has been doing what she could;
and you, her father, who ought to have known better, have
encouraged her. Rascals! rogues!—rogues all!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And oh, how honest am I!—eh, Pasco?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Of course I’m an honest man. I don’t encourage
burglars, and murderers, and incendiaries.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I did not know that Redmore was a murderer or a
burglar.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Who can say but, having been an incendiary, he may
go on to murder and plunder; these things run together.
One who can commit arson is capable of doing the other
crimes as well. I shall have to drive back to Ashburton
alone.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Kitty returns with you.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>“What help is there in Kitty? That fellow Roger, full
of rage and desire of revenge, is about the woods, and may
shoot me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He has not a gun.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He may spring upon me with his axe.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He has thrown it away,” said Kate.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You mind your own concerns,” exclaimed the angry
man, turning on his niece. “There are plenty of ways in
which he may fall on me and murder me, and then he will
pick my pockets and make off in my clothes, and Kitty
will help him.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You are talking nonsense, Pasco. Are you such a
weakling that you cannot defend yourself? But, pshaw!
the man will not injure you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He will steal by night to Coombe. His wife is there;
his children are there. He knows where I am. He has
sworn revenge against me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“When? When he escaped?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No; before I set the men after him.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Before he knew you would hunt him? A probable
story!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Probable or improbable, it is true. I threatened him,
and I would have arrested him, but could not. Kate knows
I had him by the throat; but he was armed with his axe,
and I could not retain him. Then he swore he would do
me an evil turn, and he will keep his word.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He cannot harm you; he is afraid for himself.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He can harm me. He can do to my house, my stores,
what he did to Pooke’s rick.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>“Well, that would not hurt you greatly; you are insured
over value.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not over value, with the wool in.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You were a fool about that wool, Pasco. Why did you
not consult me before dealing with Coaker? I knew of
the fall.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, you know everything. You knew that the Brimpts
oak bark was worth three times more than it is; and now
you are felling, without considering that the bark at present
is practically worthless.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The sap doesn’t run.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If the sap ran like the Dart, it would not make the bark
sell for tan. You either knew nothing about the conditions,
or you wilfully deceived me; and I dare be sworn it was
the latter. I can believe even that of you now, a favourer
of incendiaries.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Come, do not be extravagant. What other criminals
have I ever favoured?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am too hot and too angry to argue,” retorted Pasco.
“But I want to know something for certain about this
Brimpts wood. It is well enough to cut it down, but what
I want to know is, how will you transport the oak so as to
make it pay?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Sell on the spot.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“To whom?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“To timber merchants.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“They will reckon the cost of carriage.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“We shan’t have to pay for it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“We shall sell at a good price.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>“We shall sell! Such oak as Brimpts oak is not to be
had every day.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Have you offered it to anyone—advertised it?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, I have not. Time for that when it is all felled.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You will make as much a misreckoning in this as you
have along of the bark.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Trust me. The oak will sell high.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You said the same of the bark. All your ducks are
swans. I <em>must</em> have money.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“So must I,” said Quarm. “I want it as the March
fields want April showers.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am in immediate need,” urged Pepperill.</p>

<p class='c001'>“In a fortnight I shall require money to pay the men
their wages,” observed Quarm.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have nothing. You were right; I have a cash-box,
but no cash in it. I have paid away all I had.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Dispose of something,” said Quarm cheerily.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Dispose of what? Coals? No one wants coals now.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then something else.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Wool, and lose on every pound? That were fatal. I
have not paid for all the wool yet. I want money to satisfy
the coal-merchant, money to meet the bill I gave Coaker;
and then the agent for the bank which has its hold on the
Brimpts estate says we may not remove a stick till everything
is paid.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then do not remove,” said Quarm. “Sell on the spot.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“To whom?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There are plenty will buy.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why have you not advertised?” asked Pasco testily.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>“For one thing, because I did not know you were in
immediate need of cash; for the other, because, till the
timber is down, it cannot be measured. Never sell sticks
standing. A timber merchant will always buy the trees
before felled, and many a landowner is fool enough to sell
standing trees. The merchant knows his gain; the landlord
does not know his loss.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Felled or unfelled, I must realise. My condition is
desperate. I cannot meet any of the demands on me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Pepperill had lost his purple colour. He wiped his brow
again, but this time the drops did not rise from heat, but
from uneasiness of mind.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You have drawn me into this Brimpts venture, and I
have now all my fortunes on one bottom. If this fails, I am
ruined; there will remain nothing for me but to sell Coombe
Cellars, and then—I am cast forth as a beggar into the
roads. I have trusted you; you must not fail me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, all will come right in the end.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The end—the end! It must come right now. I tell
you that I have to meet the demands of the bank, or I can
do nothing with the sale of the oak, and all now hangs on
that. Owing to the ruinous purchase of Coaker’s fleeces, I
am driven to desperate straits. I cannot sell them at a
loss. I calculated it with the schoolmaster—a loss of some
hundred and twenty pounds. You must help me out of
my difficulty.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I can but suggest one thing. Go to Devonport, and
see if the Government Dockyard will buy the oak. Ship-building
can’t go on without material. If Government will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>take the timber, you need not concern yourself about the
bank’s demand; it will be satisfied, and more than satisfied,
that the money is safe. Bless you! in these times a man
is happy to see his money within twelve months of him,
and know he must have it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I don’t mind; but I’ll go to Devonport at once,” said
Pepperill.</p>

<p class='c001'>Whilst the conversation thus detailed was taking place,
the three had crossed a strip of moor that intervened
between Sharpitor and the high road, walking slowly, for
Pasco was fagged with his scramble, and Jason was
crippled.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I don’t mind,” said Pasco again. “But I shall want a
few pounds to take me there, and my pockets are empty.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I can’t help you. Mine wouldn’t yield if wrung out.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Here comes the parson,” said Pepperill—"our parson,
jogging along as if nothing were the matter and went
contrary in the world. I’ll borrow of him."</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, uncle,” protested Kate, flushing crimson, “pray
do not, if you have no chance of paying.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You impudent hussy, mind your own concerns,”
answered Pasco angrily. “I, with no chance of paying!
I’m a man of means. I’ll let you see what that signifies.
How d’ y’ do, parson?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What! my churchwarden?” exclaimed Mr. Fielding,
drawing rein. “What brings you to the moors?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Business, sir, a trifle with regard to oak timber. I’ve
bought the Brimpts wood—cost me a few hundred, and
will bring me a thousand.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>“Glad to hear it, Mr. Pepperill;—and then we shall have
a double subscription to our school.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I daresay, Mr. Fielding; I’m a free man with my
money, as you and others have found. And, by the way,
talking of that, could you kindly accommodate me with a
little loan of a few pounds. I started from home without
a thought but of returning to-day, and I learn that the
Government has an eye on these oaks—first-rate timber—and
I must to Devonport to strike a bargain. I won’t
come to their terms, they must come to mine. Such
timber as this is worth its weight in gold.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“How much do you want, Mr. Pepperill?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“How much can you spare, Mr. Fielding?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, let me see.” The rector of Coombe opened his
purse. “I have about six guineas here. I shall want to
retain one for current expenses. When can you let me
have the loan returned.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Any day. I’ll drop you a line to my wife—or—on my
return. I’m only going to Devonport to get the best price
for the timber, and then I shall be back. If you can spare
me five guineas—or five sovereigns—I shall be obliged.
You know me—a man of substance, a man of means, a
warm man. We represent the Church, do we not, Mr.
Fielding? and hang Dissenters all, say I.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I can let you have five pounds,” said the rector; “I
see I am short of silver.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That will suffice,” answered Pasco, with dignity. “I
will let you have it back directly I have settled with
Government about the oaks.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>Mr. Fielding gave Pepperill the gold, then excused
himself, as he desired to reach home before dark, and rode
on his way.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I had no idea that to borrow was so easy,” said Pasco.
“Of course, all depends on the man who asks. Everyone
knows me—sound as the Bank of England.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And same thing,” said Quarm; “all depends on the
man solicited.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then Pepperill, with his hands in his pockets and head
in the air, his spirits revived as though he had borrowed
five hundred pounds in place of five pounds, walked towards
Dart-meet Bridge humming the old harvest song,—</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c010'>With five pounds in his pocket, Pepperill drove to
Plymouth and on to Devonport. His moral
courage was up again now he had gold to spend. When
his purse was empty, his spirits, his tone of mind, became
depressed and despairing. A very little—a few pounds—sufficed
to send them up to bragging point. There was no
limit to his self-complacency and assurance as he appeared
at the dockyard.</p>

<p class='c001'>His spirits, his consequence that had so risen, were
doomed to sink when he learned that no oak, however
good, was required. Okehampton Park, the finest, the
most extensive in the county, had been delivered over by
the impecunious owners to the woodman; thousands of
magnificent trees, as ancient and as sound as those of
Brimpts, had been felled. The market was glutted, oak
of the best quality sold cheap as beech; and the Government
had bought as much at Okehampton as would be
needed for several years.</p>

<p class='c001'>“That is the way with all Government concerns, stupidly
managed by blunderheads. I can do business better with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>private firms. I know very well what this means—to grease
the palms of the authorities. I am a man of principle—I
won’t do it.” So said Pepperill, as he swung away from
the dockyard. “Bah! I’ve always been a staunch supporter
of Church and State, churchwarden and Tory. If the
Government can’t oblige me when I want a little favour
done, but must go to the cheapest shop, blow me if I don’t
turn Whig—that’s not bad enough—roaring Radical, and
cry, Down with the Constitution and the Crown! As for
the Church, I don’t say as I’ll go in for disestablishment
and disendowment just now. There is some benefit in an
Established Church when it will accommodate one at a
pinch with five pounds, and don’t press to have it returned
till convenient.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Pasco betook himself now to private firms of shipbuilders,
but was unable to dispose of his timber. The mowing
down of Okehampton Park had flooded the market with
first-quality oak. One firm was inclined to deal with him,
if he would draw the timber into Plymouth. Sanguine at
this undertaking, he returned to Dart-meet to drive a bargain
with some of the farmers on the moor for conveying the
oak logs to the seaport town. He found that their charges
were likely to be high. The way was long, the road hilly,
in places bad. It would take them two days at least to
convey each load, with a pair of horses, or a team of three,
to Plymouth; and what was one load?—what, but a single
log. Then there was the return journey, that might be done
in a long day; but after three such days, the horses would
not be fit for work on the fourth. A pair of horses was ten
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>shillings; and for three days—that was five-and-twenty; but
in reality three horses would be needed, and that would be
thrice fifteen—two pounds five for each stick of timber
before it was sold. As for the spray,—all the upper portion
of the trees,—that would have to be disposed of on the
spot; and Pepperill foresaw, with something like dismay,
that he would get no price for it. The expense of carriage
would deter all save moor farmers from purchasing, and
they were so few in number, that the supply would exceed
the demand, especially as they could have as much turf as
they wanted for the cutting; and practically not sufficient
would be got from the sale of the faggot wood to pay for
the felling of the timber.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is one of the peculiar features of England that our
roads are absolutely without any of the facilities which
modern engineering would yield to travellers on wheels.
Our ancient highways were those struck out by packmen,
and when wheeled conveyances came into use, the carriages
had to scramble over roads only suitable for pack-horses.
In France and Germany it is otherwise, there modern road-engineering
has made locomotion easy. The main arteries
of traffic ascend and descend by gentle gradients, and
make sweeps where a direct course would be arduous and
exhaustive of time.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now the road from Dart-meet, a main thoroughfare over
the moor, might be carried along the river-bank, with a
gentle fall of a hundred feet in the mile, for six miles. But
instead of that, it scrambles for a mile up a hogsback of
moor, nearly five hundred feet in sheer ascent, then comes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>down to the Dart again; then scrambles another ridge,
and then again descends to the same river. Nothing could
be easier than to have a trotting road the whole way; but
in mediæval times packmen went up and down hill; consequently
we in our brakes, and landaus, and dog-carts must
do the same; not only so, but the transport of granite,
peat, wool, and the oaks from the felled forest was rendered
a matter of heavy labour and great cost. Pepperill saw that
it was quite hopeless to expect to effect any dealings on the
Ashburton side, on account of the tremendous hills that
intervened.</p>

<p class='c001'>With rage and mortification at his heart, he sought for
his brother-in-law, and could not find him. He was told
that Quarm had gone to Widdecomb. Some repairs were
to be done in the church, the parsonage was to be rebuilt,
and he was going to ascertain whether oak timber would be
required there, and how much, and whether he could
dispose of some of the wood of Brimpts for this object.</p>

<p class='c001'>He could not wait for Quarm. He wanted to be home.
He was to convey Kate to Coombe Cellars—it had been
so arranged. His wife was impatient for her return, had
begun to discover what a useful person in the house Kate
was. Moreover, the moor air had done what was required
of it, had restored health to the girl’s cheeks.</p>

<p class='c001'>In rough and testy tone, Pepperill told his niece to put
together her traps and to jump up beside him.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You’ve had play enough at our expense,” he growled.
“Your aunt has had to hire a girl, and she’s done nothing
but break, break—and she’s given Zerah cheek—awful.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>Time you was back. We can’t be ruined just because your
father wants you to be a lady, and idle. We’re not
millionaires, that we can afford to put our hands in our
pockets and spend the day loafing. If your father thinks
of bringing you up to that, it’s a pity he hasn’t made
better ventures with his money.” After a pause, with a
burst of rancour, “His money! <em>His</em> money, indeed! it
is mine he plays games with, it is my hard-earned coin he
plays ducks and drakes with—chucks it away as though I
hadn’t slaved to earn every groat.”</p>

<p class='c001'>As he talked, he worked himself up into great wrath;
and like a coward poured forth his spite upon the harmless
child at his side, because harmless, unable to retaliate.
He was accustomed to hear his wife find fault with Kate,
and now he followed suit. We all, unless naturally
generous, cast blame on those who are beneath us; on
our children, our servants, the poor and weak, when we
are conscious of wrong within ourselves, but are too proud
for self-accusation. It has been so since Adam blamed
Eve for his fall, and Eve threw the blame on the serpent.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I don’t hold with holiday-making,” said Pasco. “It is
all very well for wealthy people, but not for those who are
workers for their daily bread. I might ha’ been, and I
would ha’ been, an independent man, and a gentleman
living on my own means, but for your father. He’s been
the mischief-maker. He has led me on to speculate in
ventures that were rotten from root to branch, and all my
poor savings, and all that your aunt Zerah has earned by
years of toil—it is all going—it is all gone. There are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>those workmen cutting down the oak, they are eating my
silver, gorging themselves on my store, and reducing me
and Zerah to beggary. To the workhouse—that’s our
goal. To the workhouse—that is where your father is
driving us. What are you staring about you for like an
owl in daylight?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, uncle,” answered Kate in a voice choked with
tears, “I have been so happy on the moor, and it is all
so beautiful, so beautiful—a heaven on earth; and I was
only looking my last—and saying good-bye to it all.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not listening to what I said?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Indeed I was, and I was unhappy—and what you said
made me feel I should never come back here, and I must
work hard now for Aunt Zerah. There was no harm in
my looking my last at what I have loved and shall not see
again! It is so beautiful.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Beautiful? Gah!” retorted Pasco. “A beastly place.
What is beautiful here? The rocks? The peat? The
heather? Gah! It is all foul stuff—I hate it. What are
you hugging there as if it were a purse of gold?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, uncle, it is something I love so! The schoolmaster
sent it me by Mr. Fielding. It’s only a book.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“A book? of what sort? Let me see.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Kate reluctantly produced the cherished volume.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Pshaw!” said Pasco, rejecting it with disgust. “Poetry—rotten
rubbish—I hate it. It’s no good to anyone, it
stuffs heads with foolery. I wish I was king, and I’d
make it a hanging matter to write a line of poetry and
publish it. It’s just so much poison. No wonder you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>don’t like work, when you read that vile, unwholesome
trash.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Kate hastily folded up the volume and replaced it in
her bosom.</p>

<p class='c001'>“No wonder you and your father encourage vagabonds
and incendiaries if you read poetry.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Father did not help Roger Redmore to escape,” said
Kate. “It was I who rolled down the stones. Father
came up when he had already got away to a hiding-place.
I, and I alone, did it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“More shame to you! You’re a bad girl, a vicious girl,
and will come to no good.”</p>

<p class='c001'>He continued grumbling and snarling and harping on
his grievances, and, for some while, jerking out spiteful
remarks. Presently he relapsed into silence, and let the
tired cob jog along till he reached a point where, near
Holne, roads branched: one went down the hill to Ashburton
without passing through the village, the other went
round by the church and village inn. Here Pasco drew
up, uncertain which road to take. There was not much
difference in the distance. The direct way was the shorter,
but by not more than half a mile, whereas the other afforded
opportunity for refreshment.</p>

<p class='c001'>At this point was a carpenter’s shop. The workman
was not there, but he had left his shop open, and outside
was a great pile of shavings.</p>

<p class='c001'>As Pasco sat ruminating, doubtful which way to take,
his eye rested for some while on the shavings. Presently,
without a word, he got out of the conveyance, let down
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>the back of the cart, collected as many shavings as he
could carry, and thrust them in, under the seat. He went
back to the pile, took as many more as he thought would
suffice, and crammed the body of the cart with them.
Then, still without speaking, he shut the back, remounted,
and drove down the shortest way—the steep hill, the direct
road to Ashburton that avoided the village.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Uncle!” said Kate, after a while.</p>

<p class='c001'>Pepperill started, as though he had been stung.
“Bless me!” he exclaimed; “I had forgotten you were
here.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Uncle,” pursued the girl, “you know my dear mother
left a little money, a few hundred pounds, for me. And
my father is trustee, and he has charge of it, and has
invested it somewhere for me. If you are in difficulties,
and really want money, I am sure you are heartily welcome
to mine. I will ask my father to let you have the use of
it. I cannot do other—you and Aunt Zerah have been
very kind to me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, that we have, and been to tremendous expense
over your keep; and there was your education with Mr.
Puddicombe, and the doctor’s bill coming in, and the
medicines; and there has been your clothing—and you
have always eaten—awful. That costs money, and ruins
one. Yes, you are right, you couldn’t do other. I had
not thought of that. But I don’t know what your father
will say.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“In a very few years I shall be old enough to have it
as my own to do with as I like. I do not think that my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>father will object to its being employed as I wish. And I
know it will be quite safe with you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, perfectly safe, safe as in the Bank of England.
I’m one of your sound men. Sound, and straight, and
square, all round—everything you can desire, you know.
Everyone trusts me. A man of substance, a man of
means—and with a head for business.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I will ask father when I see him.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That is right. It will be a little relief. You are a
good girl, I always said you were, and had your heart in
the right place. You will write to your father to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Pasco Pepperill was comparatively genial, even boastful,
on the rest of the way. When he arrived at Coombe
Cellars, his wife heard the wheels and came to the door.
She received Kate without cordiality, and took her husband’s
little bag of clothes he had taken with him. Kate
carried hers in her hand.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Anything in the cart? Shall I open?” asked Zerah.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nothing—absolutely nothing. Leave the cart alone,”
answered Pasco hastily. “Nothing at all.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Pepperill drew his horse away, unharnessed it, and ran
the dog-cart into the coach-house. Then he stood for a
moment musing, and looking at it. Presently he turned
his back, locked the door, and left his conveyance undischarged
of its load of shavings.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I may chuck ’em away, any time,” said he, “or give
’em to Zerah to kindle her kitchen fire with, or”— He
did not finish the sentence, even in thought.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXV <br /><span class='small'>BORROWING AGAIN</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c010'>When Pepperill, tired with his long day’s journey,
and harassed in mind, went to his bedroom,
Zerah at once fell upon him.</p>

<p class='c001'>“How have you fared, I’d like to know? But lawk!
what’s the good of my axing, when I’m pretty confident
your journey has been all down hill, with an upset of the
cart presently.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And if it be so, who is to blame but your brother?”
retorted Pepperill angrily.</p>

<p class='c001'>“My brother may have made his mistakes sometimes,
but not always—you never by any chance fail to do the
wrong thing.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He has dragged me into this confounded affair of the
Brimpts timber; and now—I cannot sell the bark or the
oaks.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He had nothing to say to the wool. What made you
buy at a wrong price?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The market is always changing.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes—against your interests. We shall end in the
workhouse.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>“Things will come right.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“They cannot. Look here! Here is a lawyer’s letter
about the coals. You must pay by the first of the next
month, or they will put in the bailiffs.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It will come right. I have had an offer.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“For the oak?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, of a loan. Kate, like a good and reasonable and
affectionate girl, is going to get Jason to withdraw her
money and lend it to me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Zerah flushed crimson. “So!” she exclaimed, planting
herself in front of her husband, and lodging her hands on
her hips; “you want to swindle the orphan out of her little
fortune. You know as well as I do, if that money gets
into your hands, it will run between your fingers as has
all other money that ever got there. Folks say that there
is a stone as turns all base metal to gold. I say that your
palm has the faculty of converting gold into quicksilver,
that escapes and cannot be recovered.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“This is only a temporary embarrassment.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It shall not be done,” said Zerah. “I don’t myself
believe Jason will hear of it, and if he does, and prepares
to carry it out, I’ll knock his head off—that’s my last word.
The parson said I didn’t love Kate, that I was starving her;
but I’ll stand up for her against you—and her own father
if need be.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The coal merchant must wait,” said Pasco, shrugging
his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c001'>“He will not wait. You have passed over unnoticed
his former demands, and now, unless in a fortnight the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>money is paid, he will make the house too hot to hold
us.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“We can sell something.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What? You have parted with your farm, the orchard,
the meadow—with everything but the house, to follow your
foolish passion to be a merchant.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He must wait. I have to wait till folk pay me my
little bills. Money doesn’t come in rushes, but in leaks.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He will not wait. Where is the ready money to come
from?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Pasco scratched his head.</p>

<p class='c001'>“If everything else fails,” said she further, “then I propose
you go to old Farmer Pooke and get a loan of him.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Pooke? he won’t lend money.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am not so sure of that. Jan has called several times
since Kitty has been away, and yesterday he told me, in
his shy, awkward fashion, that he had spoken with his
father about her. The old man made some to-do—he had
fancied Rose Ash as a match for his son, as she is likely to
have a good round sum of money; but when Jan insisted,
he gave way. You see everyone in the place knows that
Kate has something left by her mother, but they don’t
know how much, and, instead of three hundred pounds or
so, they have got the notion into their heads that it is a
thousand pounds. Now, as the father is ready to let his
son marry Kate, I think it like enough he would help you,
so as to prevent the scandal of bailiffs in Coombe Cellars.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He may make that the excuse for breaking off the
match.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>“Jan is obstinate. When that lad sets his head on a
thing, there is no turning him, and that his father knows
well. He’d ha’ turned his son away from Kitty and on to
Rose if he could, but he can’t do it; and what he is aware
of is, that the least show of opposition will make Jan ten
times more set on it than before.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then you go to Farmer Pooke and borrow.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I! I made to go round as a beggar-woman! You
have brought trouble on the house. You must ask for the
loan.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Next day, Pasco Pepperill started for Pooke’s house.
The lion is said to lash itself with its tail till it lashes itself
into fury. Pasco blustered and bragged with everyone he
encountered, till he had worked himself up into self-confidence
and assurance enough for his purpose, and then,
with bold face and swaggering gait, entered the farm-house.</p>

<p class='c001'>Pooke senior was a stout man, as became a yeoman of
substance; he had a red, puffed face, with stony dark eyes;
his hands were enormous, and their backs were covered
with hair.</p>

<p class='c001'>Pooke and Pepperill had not been on the best of terms.
Pooke for some time had been churchwarden, but in a fit
of pique had thrown up the office, when Pepperill had been
elected in his room. But Pooke had not intended his
resignation to be accepted seriously. He had withdrawn
to let the parish feel that it had absolutely no one else fit
to take his place, and he had anticipated that he would
have been entreated to reconsider his resignation. When,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>however, Pepperill stepped into his vacant office, and everything
went on as usual, Pooke was very irate, and spoke of
the supplanter with bitterness and contempt.</p>

<p class='c001'>“How do y’ do?” said Pooke, and extended his hand
with gracious condescension, such as he only used to the
rector and to those whom he considered sufficiently well-off
to deserve his salutation. “What have you come here
about?—that matter of Jan?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, now,” answered Pepperill, with a side look at a
servant, “between ourselves, you know, we are men who
conduct business in a different way from the general
run.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Get along with you, Anne,” said Pooke to the maid.
“Now we are by ourselves, what is it? That boy Jan is
headstrong. It runs in the blood. I married, clean contrary
to my father’s wishes, just because I knew he didn’t
like the girl. I don’t think that it was anything else made
me do it. But your niece, Kitty, has money.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Money? oh, of course! We are a moneyed family.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That is well. Mine is a moneyed family. One cannot
be comfortable oneself without money, nor have anything
to do comfortably with other people unless they’re moneyed.
I have often thought there is a great gulf fixed between the
comfortably off and those who are in poor circumstances,
and those who are in comfort can’t pass to the other side—not
right they should; let them make their associates
among the comfortably off. That’s my doctrine.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And mine also,” said Pasco. “I like to hear you talk
like this—it’s wholesome.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>“Well, and what do you want with me?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Pepperill crossed his legs, uncrossed them, and crossed
them again.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I’ve been doing a lot o’ business lately,” said he.</p>

<p class='c001'>“So I hear. But do you want to do business with me?
I bought your orchard and meadow. There I think you
did wrong. Hold on to land; never let that go—that’s my
doctrine. You got rid of it, and where are you now? In
Coombe Cellars, without as much as five acres around it of
your own.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I never was calculated to be a farmer,” said Pasco.
“My head was always set on a commercial life, and I
can’t say I regret it. A lot of money has passed through
my hands.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I don’t care so much for the passing as the sticking of
money,” retorted Pooke.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, in my line, money comes in with a tide and goes
out with a tide. When it is out, it is very much out indeed;
but I have only to wait awhile, and, sure as anything in
nature, in comes the tide once more.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Pooke’s stony eye was fixed on Pepperill.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Which is it now—high tide or low water?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There it is—low.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Pooke thrust his chair back, and looked at the space
between him and Pepperill, as though it were the great gulf
fixed, across which no communication was possible.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Merely temporary,” said Pasco, with affected indifference.
“Nevertheless, unpleasant rather; not that I am
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>inconvenienced and straitened myself, but that I am unable
to extend my money ventures. You see, I have been buying
a great oak wood on Dartmoor—splendid oak, hard as
iron; will make men-of-war, with which we shall bamboozle
the French and Spaniards. Then I’ve bought in a quantity
of wool.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What, now? It is worth nothing.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Exactly—because there is a panic. In my business
this is a time for buying. There will be a rebound, and I
shall sell. It is the same with coals. I lay in now when
cheap, and sell when dear—in winter.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What do you want with me?” asked Pooke
suspiciously.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The thing is this. I find I have to pay for the timber
before I can sell a stick to Government, and I haven’t the
cash at this instant. I’ve had to pay for the wool,—I
bought in two years’ fleeces,—and for the coals, and if I
could lay my hand on four hundred pounds”—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Four hundred pound ain’t things easy laid hands
on.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I want the money for three months at the outside.
I’ll give you my note of hand, and what interest you
demand.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Likely to make a good thing out of Government? I’ve
always heard as dealing with Government is like dealing
with fools—all gain your side, all loss theirs.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well! ’Tis something like that,” said Pepperill, with
a knowing wink. “But don’t trouble yourself; if you can’t
conveniently raise four or five hundred, I can easily go
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>elsewhere. I came to you, because my wife said there was
likely to be a marriage between the families, and so I
thought you might help me to make this hit.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Now, look here,” said Pooke. “I’ve often had a notion
I should like to deal with Government. I’ve a lot of hay
and straw.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I’m your man. Trust me. If I get to deal with
Government about the timber, they’ll have confidence in
me, for the oak is about first-rate, and no <a id='corr71.9'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='mistake'>mistake.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_71.9'><ins class='correction' title='mistake'>mistake.</ins></a></span> They’ll
become confiding, and I’ll speak a word for you. But if
you haven’t any loose cash, such as four or five hundred
pounds”— Pepperill stood up, and took his hat.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Don’t go in a hurry,” said Pooke. “That’s been my
ambition, to deal with Government. Then if one has
mouldy hay, one can get rid of it at a good figure, and
Government is so innocent, it will buy barley straw for
wheaten.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If you are so hard up that you have no money”—</p>

<p class='c001'>“I—I hard up? Sit down again, Pasco.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Pooke considered for a moment, and then said, “Now, I
know well enough that in business matters sometimes one
wants a loan. It is always so. If you’ll just give me a leg
up with Government, I don’t mind accommodating you.
But—I must have security.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“On my stores?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No; they might sell out. On your house.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Won’t my note of hand do?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, it won’t,” answered Pooke. “See here: my Jan
has gone down your way to make it up with Kitty. When
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>they have settled, you get me your deeds, and then I don’t
mind advancing the sum you want on that security—that
is, if Kitty accepts Jan.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“She will do so, of course,” said Pepperill.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, of course,” said Pooke.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXVI <br /><span class='small'>SILVER PENINKS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c010'>As soon in the morning as Kate could disengage herself
from the tasks which her aunt at once imposed on
her, she ran to the cottage occupied by the wife and children
of Roger Redmore. It was of cob, or clay and straw beaten
and trampled together, then shaved down, and the whole
thatched.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such cottages last for centuries, and are warm and dry.
So long as the thatch is preserved over the walls, there is
simply no saying how long they may endure, but if the rain
be suffered to fall on the top of the walls, the clay crumbles
rapidly away. The cob is usually whitewashed, and the
white faces of these dwellings of the poor under the brown
velvet-pile thatched roofs, with the blinking windows beneath
the straw thatching just raised, like the brow of a sleepy
eye, have an infinitely more pleasing, cosy appearance than
the modern cottages of brick or stone, roofed with cold blue
slate.</p>

<p class='c001'>The cottage of the Redmores was built against a red
hedge, rank with hawthorn and primroses. But in verity it
was no longer the cottage of the Redmores, for the family
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>had been given notice to quit, and although after Lady-Day
Farmer Pooke had suffered the woman to inhabit it
for a few weeks, yet now the term of his concession was
exceeded. He had a new workman coming in, and the
unhappy woman was forced to leave.</p>

<p class='c001'>When Kate arrived at the dwelling, she found that some
sympathetic neighbours were there, who were assisting Jane
Redmore to remove her sticks of furniture from the interior.
The labourer who was incomer was kindly, and also lent a
hand. Her goods had been brought out into the lane, and
were piled up together against the bank, and on them she
sat crying, with her children frightened and sobbing around
her. Neighbours had been good to her, and now endeavoured
to appease the tears and distress of the children
with offers of bread and treacle, and bits of saffron cake, and
endearments. The woman herself was helpless; she did
not know whither she should betake herself for the night,
where she should bestow her goods.</p>

<p class='c001'>The incomer urged Mrs. Redmore to tell him what were
her intentions. He must bring in his own family that afternoon,
and would help her, as much as he was able, to settle
herself somewhere. It was not possible for her to remain in
the road. The parish officers would interfere, and carry her
off to the poorhouse; but it was uncertain whether she could
be accommodated there, interposed a neighbour, as the house
was full of real widows.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mrs. Redmore was a feeble, incapable creature, delicate,
without the mental or moral power of rising to an emergency
and forming a resolution. She sat weeping and crying out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>that she was without Roger, and he always managed for
her.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But you see, Jane,” argued a neighbour, “as how Roger
can’t be here for very good reasons, which us needn’t
mention, and so someone must do something, and who else
is there but you?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I wish I was dead,” wailed the poor creature.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, now, Jane,” said the neighbour, “don’t ye
be so silly. If you was dead, what ’d become o’ the
childer?”</p>

<p class='c001'>At this juncture Kate arrived, breathless with running.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is well.” She stood panting, with her eyes bright with
pleasure at the consciousness that she brought relief. “I
asked my father, and he says Mrs. Redmore and the little ones
may go into his cottage at Roundle Post, and stay there till
something is settled.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That’s brave!” exclaimed the women who were standing
round. “Now, let me take the little ones, Jane, and you
lead the way, and Matthew Woodman, he’ll help to carry
some of your things.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have the key,” said Kate; “and the distance is nothing.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Lawk a mussy!” exclaimed one of the women; “what
would us ever a’ done wi’out you, Kitty. The poor creetur
is that flummaged and mazed, her don’t seem right in her
head, and us couldn’t do nothing with she.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mrs. Redmore caught Kate’s hand, and kissed it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“We’d all a’ died here, but for you,” she said.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Indeed,” answered Kate, hastily snatching her hand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>away, “it is my father who has come to your assistance
not I. He lends you the house.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But you axed him for it. Oh, if Roger could do anything
for you!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I assure you my father is the one to be thanked, if anyone
is.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, if Roger could do aught for he, it would be the
same as to you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Come, let us be on the move.”</p>

<p class='c001'>A little procession formed—women carrying the children,
or crocks, a couple of men with wheelbarrows, removing
some of the heavier goods. Then up came Jan Pooke,
and at once offered his assistance, and worked as hard as
any.</p>

<p class='c001'>As soon as the poor woman was settled into her new
quarters, Jan sidled up to Kate, and, seizing her hand and
breathing heavily, said, “Kitty, I want to say something to
you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The girl looked at him inquiringly, waiting for what he
had to say.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I mean, Kitty, alone.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am Kitty Alone,” observed she, with a smile.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I don’t mean that. I have something I want to say to
you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What is it?” said she. “You look very odd.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It’s—it’s—the silver peninks.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What of them?”</p>

<p class='c001'>It must be premised that the “silver peninks” are the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>narcissus poeticus</em></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>“They are in an orchard.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I know it,” said Kate. “Lovely they are—and yet,
somehow, I like the daffodils as well.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Now, it’s a curious thing,” said Jan, “that the same
roots bring up first daffies, and then silver peninks.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That is not possible,” objected Kate.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But it is so. Come into the orchard, Kitty, and see for
yourself.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I know, without seeing, that it cannot be.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If you will come and look, Kitty, you will see that just
where the daffies were, there the peninks are now. When
the daffies die down, the peninks bloom.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Exactly, Jan, because their time for blooming is a month
later than the daffodils.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But they come out of the same roots.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That cannot be, by any means.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Pooke rubbed his head, and said humbly, “I know,
Kitty, I’m a duffer, and that you’re clever, but I’ve seen ’em
with my own eyes.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Have you ever dug up the bulbs?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, I can’t say I have done that.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Till you have, you cannot say that the golden flower
and the silver flower spring from one root.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It isn’t only the peninks, Kitty—can’t you understand?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I do not. You are very wonderful to-day.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I want to talk to you in the orchard.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You can say what it is, here.”</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='corr77.26'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='‘No,'>“No,</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_77.26'><ins class='correction' title='‘No,'>“No,</ins></a></span> I cannot. I want to show you the silver peninks,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>and I want to say”—he let go her hand, with which he had
been sawing.</p>

<p class='c001'>Kate looked round. It would be considerate to leave
the poor woman alone with her children to get settled into
her new quarters, and she desired to escape another outburst
of gratitude.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, Jan, I will go and look at the flowers, and I hope
to show you your mistake—the withered heads of <a id='corr78.8'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='daffodill'>daffodil</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_78.8'><ins class='correction' title='daffodill'>daffodil</ins></a></span>
apart from the bursting bud of the penink.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The two young people walked together down the lane to
the gate into the orchard. Jan threw this open, and Kate,
without hesitation, stepped in.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Now,” said Jan, “I said it was not the peninks.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What is not the peninks—the daffodils? I thought
you said that the one plant was the same which throws up
yellow flowers and white ones.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You try not to understand me, Kitty.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am trying hard to understand you, Jan.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Look here,” he exclaimed, letting go the gate. Kate
did as desired; she looked him full in the face. His mouth
was twitching. “Tell me, Kate”—</p>

<p class='c001'>She waited for him to conclude the sentence, and as he
did not, she asked him gently what it was that he desired
her to tell him.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You know already what I mean,” he exclaimed, breathing
short and quick.</p>

<p class='c001'>Kate shook her head.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Look here, Kitty. My father has given his consent at
last, and I am going to be married.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>“I am so glad to hear it, Jan.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Kate, you tease me. You—you”—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Indeed, I wish you all happiness.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That I can only have with you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“With me?” Kate was frightened, drew back, and fixed
her great, dark blue, tranquil eyes on him. The sweat rolled
off his brow.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, Jan! What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You know what I mean. You shall be my missus.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Jan—that cannot be.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why not? Give me your hand—no, give me both.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I cannot do that.”</p>

<p class='c001'>A pause ensued.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Kitty, you don’t care for me?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I do care for you, Jan.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then love me—take me. Sister Sue will be so
pleased.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I cannot do it, Jan, even for sister Sue.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You cannot love me?” he gasped, and his face lost its
colour. “Oh, Kitty, since we were in the boat together I
have thought only of you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And before that, of Rose. Was it not so?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, Kitty. Rose rather teased me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Jan, you are a dear, good old fellow, and I like you
better than any—I mean, almost better than anyone else
in the world.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Whom do you like better?” he inquired in a tone
between sulk and anger.</p>

<p class='c001'>“My dear father, of course.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>“Oh, your father!—anyone else?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I love the dear old parson.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The parson? why so?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Because one can learn so much from him.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, learn, learn!” exclaimed Pooke impatiently. “At
that rate you will love the schoolmaster, for he can teach
you all sorts of things—why some stars twinkle and others
do not; and why the tides do not come regular by half an
hour. If that sort of foolery suits you, he’ll do.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is no foolery, dear friend Jan. I have said that I
did regard and like you.” Her face had become crimson.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But you will not love me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Jan, I shall always think of you as a brother or a cousin.
You are so good, so true, so kind. You deserve the best
girl in Coombe, and I am not that.”</p>

<p class='c001'>He wanted to interrupt her, but she proceeded, laying
her finger-tips on his breast.</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, Jan, I am not that—I know it well; and I know
that your father, not even sister Sue, would have you marry
me. I cannot love you, and you would be unhappy with
me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why that?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Because I would be for ever asking you questions which
you could not answer. And I, with you, would not be
happy, because I could get no answers out of you. You
would be telling me such things as that silver peninks
sprang out of daffodil roots, and that—I could not believe.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“So you refuse me?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Jan, you must get a good dear wife, who will believe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>that silver peninks grow out of daffodil bulbs—will not
bother whether they do or not—one who loves you with her
whole heart. I know one who does that—no—listen to
me!” as he made a gesture of impatience, as if he would
turn away. “Let me speak plainly, Jan. Rose is a merry,
good-hearted girl; and if she has done an unkind thing to
me, it has not been out of malice, but because it made her
mad to think that you did not love her, and cared a little
for me. No one in Coombe can say a bad word against her.
She is the prettiest girl in all the country round. She is
always neat and fitty (dapper). If you know at all what
love is, Jan, you must judge how miserable Rose is, when,
loving you with all her heart, she finds you indifferent, and
even rough towards her; she hates me, only because you
prefer me to her. Your father, I am quite sure, has no
wish to see you marry anyone but Rose. Sister Sue is her
friend, and Sue knows and cares nothing about me. Let
us always remain friends. I shall ever value you for your
goodness of heart, dear Jan. I wish I could love you
enough to accept you, but I cannot—I cannot, Jan—and
after saying that silver peninks”—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, confound the peninks!” he used a worse word than
“confound.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Jan! Do not say that. It is a necessity of my heart
to learn. I must ask questions, and I never can love a
man who cannot give me something to satisfy my mind.
Dear Jan, if we were married, and you said that silver”—</p>

<p class='c001'>He stamped his feet.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, never mind the peninks. It cannot be, Jan. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>cannot be. We were never created for each other. Woman
is made out of a rib of the man to whom she must belong.
If I am so eager to ask questions, and get to know things,
that shows, Jan, I was never made out of your rib, never
taken from your side, and so never can go there.”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXVII <br /><span class='small'>TROUBLE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c010'>When Kate returned to Coombe Cellars, she saw
that some trouble had occurred. Her aunt was
sitting at the table in tears, Pasco had planted himself
on the settle, with his legs stretched before him, wide
apart, the soles turned up and his hands in his pockets.
His hat was on and he was whistling a tune—a strain out
of Jackson’s “Tee-dum”—in unconcern.</p>

<p class='c001'>Kate had heard enough of the altercations between her
aunt and uncle to be aware that their circumstances were
strained, and that Zerah disbelieved in her husband’s
business capacities. Pasco had himself admitted to her,
on the drive from Brimpts, that he was in difficulties.</p>

<p class='c001'>Zerah, so far from refraining from her comments before
Kate, hailed her entrance as an opportunity for renewing
her animadversions on Pasco.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Look here, Kitty! Here is what we have come to—read
that! Your uncle, like a reckless fool, has gone and
bought wool when there is no sale for it, and has given a
bill for it which has expired. The bank has returned it to
Coaker, dishonoured,—dishonoured, do you hear that, Pasco?—and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>here is Coaker, furious, and demanding immediate
payment. On the other side, there is the Teignmouth coal
merchant threatening proceedings. What is to be done?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Kate looked at her uncle.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Don’t be excited and angry, Zerah,” said he, with the
utmost composure. “After rain comes sunshine. It is
darkest before dawn. When the tide is at lowest ebb, it is
on the turn to the flow.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But what is to be done? Dishonoured!” exclaimed
Zerah.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Dishonoured?—fiddlesticks! The bill is returned, that
is all. The money will come.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Whence. Can you stamp on the ground and make the
coin leap up? Can you throw your net into the Teign and
gather guineas as you can shrimps?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It will come right,” said Pasco. “There is no need
for this heat, I tell you. I have seen Farmer Pooke, and
he will advance me five hundred pounds.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes—on the security of this house.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, what of that?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And five hundred pounds will not suffice to meet all
the claims.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, there are Kitty’s hundreds.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“They shall not be touched.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You promised me the loan of them, did you not, Kitty?”
asked her uncle, scarcely raising his head to look at her.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, you are heartily welcome to them,” said the girl.</p>

<p class='c001'>“They shall not be touched!” exclaimed Zerah, leaning
her fists on the table.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>“That is as Jason thinks and chooses,” answered Pasco.
“He is trustee for Kitty, not you. He got me into the
hobble, and must get me out.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What!—did he get you into this about the wool?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I should have managed about the wool, were it not for
the Brimpts business.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And the coals?” asked Zerah ironically.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I can manage well enough when not drawn away into
foreign speculations. Jason persuaded me against my will
to embark in this timber business, and that is it which is
creating this obstruction. He got me in—he must get me
out. Kate’s a good girl,—she helps, and don’t rate and
rant as you do, Zerah.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I don’t say she is not a good girl,” retorted Zerah.
“What I say is, you are a bad uncle to desire to rob
her”—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Rob her? I ask only a loan for a few weeks. Her
money and that from Pooke will set us on our feet again.”</p>

<p class='c001'>At that moment, the man just alluded to came in with
much noise. His face was red, his expression one of great
anger, and without a greeting, he roared forth—</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is an insult. The girl is an idiot. She has refused
him—him—a Pooke!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Who? What?” asked Zerah, letting go the table and
staggering back, overcome by a dreadful anticipation of evil.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Who? What?” retorted Pooke, shaking his red face
and then his great flabby hand at Kate. “She—Kitty
Alone—has said No to my John!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Zerah uttered an exclamation of dismay. Pasco’s jaw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>fell, and, drawing in his feet, he pulled his hands from his
pockets and leaned them on the arms of the settle, to be
ready to lift himself.</p>

<p class='c001'>“She—that chit—has dared to refuse him!” roared Pooke.
“Not that I wanted her as my daughter. Heaven defend!
I think my John is worth better girls than she. But that
she should have refused him—my John—she who ought to
have gone down on her knees and thanked him if he gave
her a look—that she should have the impudence—the—the”—he
choked with rage. “Now, not one penny of
mine shall you have, not on note of hand, on no security
of your beggarly house—a cockle and winkle eating tea-house—bah!—not
a penny!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then he turned, snapped his fingers at Zerah and Pasco,
and went out.</p>

<p class='c001'>There ensued a dead hush for some moments. Kate
had turned very white, and looked with large frightened
eyes at her uncle, then at her aunt. She felt that this was
but the first puff of a storm which would break in full force
on her head.</p>

<p class='c001'>Pasco stumbled to his feet, planted his right fist in the
hollow of his left palm, and, coming up close to Kate, said
hoarsely, “You won’t have him? You, you frog in a well!
You won’t have him, the richest young chap in Coombe!
I say you shall have him. You shall run after Mr. Pooke,
and say it is all a mistake—you take Jan thankfully—you
only said No just out of bashfulness, you did not think
yourself worthy. Tell him you said No because you
thought Jan was asking you against his father’s wishes.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>Say that now you know how the old man feels, you
gratefully accept. Do you hear? Run.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Kate did not move. Her head had fallen on her bosom
when he began, now she raised it, and, looking her uncle
steadily in the face, she said, “I cannot. I have told Jan
my reasons.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Reasons, indeed! precious reasons. What are they?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Kate did not answer. Her reasons were such as Pasco
could not understand.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Kate,” interposed Zerah in an agitated voice, “what
is the meaning of this?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, dear aunt, it is true, I cannot take Jan. I have
refused him, and I cannot, will not withdraw the No. In
this matter I alone am answerable, and answerable to God.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I insist,” stormed Pasco.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I cannot obey,” answered Kate.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Cannot—will not obey us who have brought you up.
I suppose next you will refuse to obey your father?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“In this matter, yes, if he were to order me to take
Jan Pooke.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I’ll force you to take him.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You cannot do that, uncle.” She spoke with composure,
whereas he was in a towering passion.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Look at this,” said he, snatching up the letter from the
table. “I’m dishonoured now, indeed, as Zerah says.
If you take Jan, all is well. The old father will find me
money, and all runs on wheels. You put in your spoke,
and everything is upset. Dishonoured, ruined, beggared—and
all through you.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>He beat down his hat over his brows, laughed wildly,
and shook his fist at Kate. “I was chucked out of the
trap t’other day. I wish I had broken my neck sooner
than come to this. I’ve nourished a viper in my bosom,
and now it turns and stings me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Leave her to me,” said Zerah. “You make matters
worse by your violence. That is the way with you men.
Leave her to me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Pasco flung himself back in the settle, and thrust out his
legs as before, and rammed his fists into his pockets.
Before he had held his chin up, now it was buried in his
shirt front.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then Zerah pulled her niece into the window. Kate
drew a long breath. She knew that now came the worst
trial of all.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Kitty,” said the aunt, holding both the girl’s arms, and
looking into her face. “Are you utterly heartless? Is it
a matter of no concern to you that we should be ruined?
You have but to run after Mr. Pooke, and all will be well.
Why should you not give way to my wishes and those of
your uncle? What have you against the lad? He is
good, and he is rich.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I do not love him,” answered Kate confusedly.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But he is so well off. There is no one with half his
prospects in the place. I can’t understand. He likes you.
He is desperately fond of you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I will never take one I do not love,” said Kate, shaking
her head.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And you have heard the condition we are in? Your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>uncle owes money on all sides. If money is due to him, he
cannot recover it. He has sold the farm, there remains
only this house. If he sells that, we are without a home.
Then where will you be? Come—yield to our wishes,
child.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I cannot, indeed I cannot,” answered Kate, trembling
in all her limbs. “I would have taken Jan if I could.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What is to prevent you?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Kate was silent.</p>

<p class='c001'>“There is—there can be no one else in the way?”
pursued Zerah.</p>

<p class='c001'>Again no answer.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Stubborn and hardhearted, that is what you are,” said
Zerah bitterly. “It is all the same to you what becomes
of us. We reared you. We have loved you. I have
been to you as a mother. You have never shown either
your uncle or me that you were grateful for what we have
done for you. Your own father you treat as though he
were a dog—take no notice of him. I have heard of
hearts of stone, I never believed in them before. I do
now. No; there is—there can be no one else so insensible.
You have not got it in you to love anyone.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Kate sighed. The tears ran down her cheeks.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Dear aunt, I have always loved you, and I love you
now, and ever will.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then show me that you have a heart,” said Zerah.
“Words without deeds are wind. If my own dear child
Wilmot had been alive, this would not have happened.
Jan would have loved her, not you; and even if she had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>not cared for him, yet, when she knew my wishes, she
would have yielded. She would have given her heart’s
blood for me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Kate pressed her folded hands to her bosom; her heart
was bursting with pain.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What is it that I ask of you?” pursued Zerah, and
brushed the tears from her own eyes. “Nothing but what
is for your own advantage, your own happiness. How will
you like starvation—rags, no roof over your head? If you
take Jan Pooke, you become the first woman in the place.
You will have money to do with just as you likes. Jan is a
good-hearted fellow. Never have you heard of his having
wronged man, woman, or child. He is amiable; you can
turn him round your little finger. What more can a woman
wish for?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Kate’s mind was tossed with trouble. She had so
often longed that the opportunity might arise for her to
prove to her aunt that she loved her. Now the occasion
had come. The future was full of threat and disaster, and
one word from her might avert this and restore serenity;
and not only would that one word relieve her uncle and
aunt in their present distress, but it would also suffice to
make poor, worthy Jan a happy man. But that word she
could not speak, she could not prevail with herself to speak
it. She liked John Pooke, and but for one thing she
perhaps might have yielded—that one thing was that she
had met with a man very different from the young yeoman,
one who could answer questions and satisfy her hungry
mind.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>“I cannot, dear auntie.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Cannot? What stands in the way? <em>Who</em> stands in
the way?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I cannot, auntie.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Perverse, headstrong, heartless child! When luck
comes to you, you throw it away, and cast your own self,
and all belonging to you, into misery. I wish you had
never come here; I wish I had never nursed you in my
arms, never cared for you as a child, never watched over
you as a grown girl.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Auntie!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Away—I will not speak to you again.”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXVIII <br /><span class='small'>ALTERNATIVES</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c010'>Pasco had left the room and the house. His anger
with Kate was obscured by his unrest as to his own
condition. What could he do? He must meet the bill
for the wool, he must pay for the Brimpts timber before
he removed any of it, or forfeit what had already been
spent over felling the trees. He must pay the coal
merchant’s account, or bailiffs would be put into the house.</p>

<p class='c001'>He went into his stores and observed the contents of his
warehouse. There was wool on the upper storey, coal was
lodged below. Above stairs all the space was pretty well
filled with fleeces.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then he went to his stable, and looked at his cob, then
into the covered shed that served as coach-house. He put
his hand in his pocket, pulled out the key, and opened the
back of the cart. The shavings he had put in were there
still. He could not carry them into the house now, whilst
Zerah was engaged with Kate. Besides, he would not
require so much kindling matter within doors. Where
should he bestow it?</p>

<p class='c001'>Suspecting that he heard a step approach, Pasco hastily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>closed the flap of the cart, and went to the front of the
shed. No one was there. He returned to the shed and
reopened the box of the cart, and filled his arms with
shavings, came out and hastily ran across with them to his
warehouse.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then he came back on his traces, carefully picking up
the particles that had escaped him. There remained more
in his dog-cart. Would it do for him to run to and fro,
conveying the light shavings from shed to warehouse?
Might it not attract attention? What would a customer
think were he to come for coals, and find a bundle of
kindling wood among them? What would neighbours
think at the light curls caught by the wind and carried
away over the fields?</p>

<p class='c001'>He went hastily back to the warehouse and collected
the bundle he had just taken there, and brought it all back
in a sack, and rammed this sack into the box of his cart;
and then went again to the stores, and raked the coals over
the particles of shavings that remained.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then Pasco harnessed his cob, and drove away to the
little town of Newton. A craving desire had come over him
to see again the new public-house erected in the place of
that which had been burnt. He had no clear notion why
he desired to see it.</p>

<p class='c001'>As he drove along, he passed the mill, and Ash, the
miller, who was standing outside his house, hailed him.</p>

<p class='c001'>“By the way, Pepperill—sorry to detain you; there is
a little account of mine I fancy has been overlooked. Will
you wait?—I will run in and fetch it; my Rose—she does
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>all the writing for me, I’m a poor scholard—she has just
made it out again. It was sent in Christmas, and forgot,
I s’pose, then again Lady-Day, and I reckon again overlooked.
You won’t mind my telling of it, and if you could
make it convenient to pay”—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Certainly, at once,” answered Pasco, and thrust his
hand into his pocket and drew it forth empty. “No hurry
for a day or two, I reckon? I find I have come away
without my purse.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh no, not for a day or two; but when it suits you,
I shall be obliged.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Will to-morrow do?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Of course. I say, Pepperill, your brother-in-law is a
right sort of a man.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why do you say that?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Giving up his cottage to that poor creetur, Jane
Redmore.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I do not understand you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What—have you not heard? There was like to be a
proper mess. Farmer Pooke wanted Roger’s cottage for
his new man, and so she, poor soul, had to turn out.
There was no help for it. She had no notion where to go,
and what to do. A lost sort of creetur I always thought,
and now that Roger is away and not to be found, and
what wi’ the death of her little maid, gone almost tottle
(silly). Her had to clear out, and folks was nigh mazed
to know what to do wi’ her, when your niece, Kitty Alone,
came and said as how her father Jason gave his cottage
till Jane Redmore could settle something.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>“I never heard a word of this till this moment,” said
Pasco. “When did it happen?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“To-day—not long ago. Jane Redmore is in Jason
Quarm’s house now. Kate gave her the key.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Pepperill grew red, and said, not looking Ash in the face,
but away at the ears of his horse, “I don’t like this—not
at all. We ought to get rid of Redmore and all his
belongings. You are not safe in your house, your mill is
not safe, I am not safe, with that firebrand coming and
going amongst us—and come and go he will so long as
his wife and children be here. He were mighty fond of
they.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Roger will do you no harm. Your people have been
good to him.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What! do you call Jason ‘my people’?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Jason and Kitty have housed his wife.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It don’t follow that he loves me. I set the men in
pursuit of him at Dart-meet, and he knows it, and hates me.
I live in fear of him as long as he is uncaught.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The miller shrugged his shoulders. “Roger is not so
bad, but Farmer Pooke did try him terrible. I won’t
detain you. You’ll mind and pay that little account, will
you not—to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes—certain.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then Pepperill drove on. He passed a man in a cart,
and the man did not salute him. In fact, the way was
narrow, and the fellow was careful that the wheels should
clear, and had not leisure to look at and touch his hat to
Pasco. But Pepperill regarded the omission as an intentional
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>slight. He was in an irritable condition, and
when shortly after he drove before a cottage, and the
woman in the doorway, hushing her child, did not address
him, or answer his address, his brows knitted and he swore
that everyone was against him. His disturbed and anxious
mind longed for recognition, flattery, to give it ease, and
unless he received this from everyone, he suspected that
there was a combination against him, that a wind of his
difficulties had got abroad, and that folk considered he was
no longer worth paying attention to.</p>

<p class='c001'>There were not many on the road, and he acted capriciously
towards those few. Some he greeted, others he
passed without notice. He fancied he detected a sneer
in the faces of such as returned his salutation or a
purposeful lessening of cordiality. On reaching the new
inn at Newton, his heart was full of anger against all
mankind.</p>

<p class='c001'>The host did not receive him with cordiality, as he
expected; he looked out at the door and went in again
with a hasty nod.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the yard Pasco cautiously opened his gig-box when
the ostler was not looking and drew out a halter, then,
hastily closed the flaps, and, extending the cord, said,
“I’m not going to stay many minutes; don’t take the
cob out of harness. Let him stand and eat a bite, that
is all.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then Pepperill went into the inn and called for a glass
of ale.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Halloa, Pepperill!” said a cheery voice, and Coaker
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>moved up to him at the table. “How are you? Sold the
wool yet? I hear there is a rise.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Pepperill drew back and turned blood-red; this was the
man to whom he owed so much money—the man to whom
he had given the bill that was dishonoured.</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, I haven’t sold,” answered Pasco surlily.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I advise you not to. You’ll make something yet.
That Australian wool won’t go down with our weavers.
It’s not our quality, too fine, not tough enough. Hold
back, and you will make your price.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That is all very well for you to say, but”— Pasco
checked himself. What was on his lips was—"It is ready-money
I need, not a profit a few months hence."</p>

<p class='c001'>“There’s good things coming to you yet,” continued
Coaker. “I heard on the moor that your brother-in-law
has near on made a sale of the Brimpts oaks.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He has?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes; there has been a timber merchant from Portsmouth
come there. He wanted the Okehampton oaks,
but was too late, they had been picked up, so he came on
to Dart-meet, and I reckon now it is only about price they
are haggling, that is all.” Coaker dropped his voice and
said, “There’s an awkwardness about that bill of yours.
Nay, don’t kick out; I won’t be so terrible down on you
just for a fortnight or three weeks. I’ll let you turn that
timber over first if you will be sharp about it. There,
don’t say I’m down on you. A fortnight or three weeks
I give you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Pasco held up his head, but the sudden elation was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>damped by the thought that he could not remove any of
the timber till the covenanted price had been paid for it,
and whence was this money to come? Money he must
have to enable him to hold on with the wool till it fetched
a better price, and to dispose of the oaks he had felled on
the moor, to enable him to escape the scandal and
humiliation of having the bailiffs put in his house by the
coal merchant.</p>

<p class='c001'>But then, in the event of a certain contingency which
loomed before Pasco’s inner eye, there would be no wool
to be disposed of, it would have been reduced to—even
to himself he would not complete the sentence.
Would that matter? The insurance would more than
cover the loss, and he would be able to dispose of the
oak.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Will you have a pipe?” asked Coaker, and after having
stuffed his tobacco into his bowl, he produced a match-box
and struck a light with a lucifer. At the period of this
tale lucifer matches were a novelty. The tinder-box was
in general use for domestic purposes, and men carried
about with them small metal boxes, armed with a steel
side, containing amadou and flint, for kindling their pipes
and cigars.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What do you call that?” asked Pepperill, observing
the proceedings of the farmer.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah! I reckon this be one of the finest inventions of
the times. Have you never seen or read of this yet? It
is better than the phosphorus bottle, and than Holmberg’s
box. Look here. This little stick has got some chemical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>stuff, sulphur and something else, phosphorus, I believe,
at the end; all you have to do is to rub, and the whole
bursts into flame.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Pepperill took the box, turned it over, opened it, looked
at and smelt the matches.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Are they terrible expensive?” he asked musingly.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh no. There, as you are curious about it, I’ll give
you the box, and you can show it to your missus.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Pasco put out his hand to shake that of Coaker. It was
cold and trembled.</p>

<p class='c001'>The devil was playing a game with him. He was offering
him a reprieve from his embarrassments, and at the same
time thrusting him forward to the accomplishment of the
evil deed on which he brooded, and was placing in his hands
the means of executing it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Pasco sank into deep thought, looking at the match-box
and playing with it, now opening, then shutting it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I’m depriving you of it,” he said.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not a bit. I have a dozen. They are just brought in
from London and are selling off amazin’ fast at Ashburton.
In a week they’ll be all over the country and the tinder
boxes chucked away.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Are they dangerous—I mean to carry about with
one?” asked Pasco.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not a bit. There is no fire till you strike it
out.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then Pepperill again fell into meditation. He put the
box into his pocket, and sat looking before him into space,
speechless.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>Suddenly a shock went through his frame. He had
been touched on the arm by Coaker.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What is it?” he asked, with quivering lips.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Look at the landlord,” said the farmer in an undertone,
with his hand to his mouth. “Do you know what folks
say of him?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Pasco asked with his eyes. He could not frame the
words with his lips.</p>

<p class='c001'>“They do say that he set fire to the old place, so
as to get the insurance money for rebuilding in grand
style.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“A tramp did it—got into the cellar,” said Pasco in a
whisper.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nobody never saw thickey tramp come, and sure and
sartain nobody never saw him go. I don’t believe in the
tramp. He did it himself.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You should not speak that unless sure of it,” said
Pepperill, thrusting back his chair. “You have no evidence.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, evidence! Folks talk, and form their opinion.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Talk first and form opinions after on the idle chatter—that’s
about it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Pasco stood up. He was alarmed. He was afraid he
had not fastened the box of his dog-cart. The flap might
have fallen, and then the interior would be exposed to
view; and what would the ostler, what would anyone
think who happened to come into the stable-yard and saw
what constituted the lading of his cart? His hand had
shaken as he turned the key, after bringing out the halter;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>almost certainly in his nervousness he had imperfectly
turned it. He could not rest. He went out into the yard
and looked at his dog-cart. It was closed. He tried the
key. The lock was fast.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Put the cob in,” said he to the ostler, and he returned,
much relieved, to the house.</p>

<p class='c001'>Coaker had departed. Pepperill called for another glass
of ale, and found interest in observing the landlord. That
man had set fire to his tavern so that he might construct
an hotel. He seemed cheery. He was not bowed down
with consciousness of guilt. His voice was loud, his spirits
buoyant. He looked Pepperill full in the eyes, and
it was the eyes of Pepperill that fell, not those of the
landlord.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I wonder,” considered Pasco, “whether he did do it,
or did not? If he did not, it is just as bad as if he did,
for people charge him with it all the same. No one will
believe he is innocent. Suppose he did it—and I reckon it
is most likely—well, Providence don’t seem to ha’ turned
against him; on the contrary, it is a showering o’ prosperity
over him. P’r’aps, after all, there ain’t no wrong in it.
It was his own house he burnt. A man may do what he
will with his own.” He put resolutely from him the
thought of fraud on the insurance company. What was a
company? Something impersonal. Then Pepperill rose,
paid for his ale, and went forth. As he jumped into the
dog-cart, the ostler held up the halter.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Will you give me the key and I will put it inside?”
asked the man.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>“No, thank you—hand it to me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The ostler gave him the halter, and Pepperill
fastened it to the splashboard and drove on. He
had attached it hastily, carelessly, and before long the
rope uncoiled and hung before him. His eyes were
drawn to it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What would come to me if the bailiffs were put into
the house, and Coombe Cellars were sold over my head to
pay what I owe?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Pasco was a man who could live only where he was
esteemed, looked up to, and where he could impose on
underlings and brag among equals. The idea of being in
every man’s mouth as “gone scatt”—a ruined man—was
intolerable. “I would die rather than that,” he exclaimed
aloud, and put his hand to the halter to twist it and knot
it again.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was a sin to commit suicide. His life was his own,
but he could not take that. His storehouse with his stores
was his own. Would it be wrong for him to destroy that?
Better that than his own life. There were but two courses
open to him. He must either use the halter for his own
neck and swing in the barn, or recover himself out of the
insurance money on his stores. He drove on brooding
over this question, arguing with his conscience, and presently
he held up his head. He saw that his life was too
precious to be thrown away. What would Zerah do without
him? He must consider his wife, her despair, her
tears. He had no right to make her a widow, homeless.
Were he to die—that would not relieve the strain. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>sale would take place just the same, and Zerah be left
destitute. Pepperill held up his head. He felt virtuous,
heroic; he had done the right thing for the sake of his
dear wife, made his election, and saw a new day dawning—dawning
across a lurid glare.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c010'>Kate fled upstairs to her bedroom, where she might
be alone and have free scope for tears. She threw
herself on her knees by her bed, and putting her hands
under the patchwork quilt, drew it over her ears and head,
that the sound of her sobs might be muffled, so as not to
reach her aunt were she to ascend the staircase. She
feared lest there should be a repetition of the scene on the
return of her father. Aunt Zerah would wait impatiently
for him, and the moment that he arrived, would pour forth
her story, not in his ear only, but in Kate’s as well, whom
she would forcibly retain to hear it and receive the reproaches
of her father. That her father would be disappointed
that she had put from her the chance of becoming
a well-to-do yeoman’s wife, she knew for certain. He had
never concerned himself very greatly about her, had never
endeavoured to sound her mind and put his finger on her
heart, and would be quite unable to appreciate the reasons
she could give for her conduct; he would look on her
refusal of young Pooke as a bit of girlish caprice. She
feared that he would view it as a bad speculation, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>would hasten off without consulting her, to endeavour to
pacify the mortified vanity of the old man, and to assure
the young one that she, Kate, had rejected him out of
girlish bashfulness, whilst loving him in her heart. There
was no bond of sympathy between her father and herself.
That which filled his mind had no place in hers; what
interested him she shrank from. She had returned from
Dartmoor with heart glowing with gratitude to him for
having insisted on her having a holiday, to her uncle for
having taken her out to Dartmoor, and to her aunt for having
spared her. It had been her desire to find occasions to
prove to them that she was grateful, and now, her first act
on return was to run contrary to their wishes, and anger
her uncle and aunt, and lay up matter for reprimand on
the arrival of her father.</p>

<p class='c001'>Her aunt had never comprehended the character of Kate,
filled to the full as her heart was with bitterness at the loss
of her own daughter. Kate was in all points the reverse of
Wilmot, and because so unlike, woke the antipathy of the
bereaved mother, as though the silence and reserve of Kate
were assumed out of slight to the memory of the merry,
open-hearted girl. She looked on her niece as perverse, as
acting in everything out of a spirit of contrariety. How
else explain that a young girl with warm blood in her veins
should not retain the longings and express the wishes
common to other girls of her age? that she had no fancy
for dress, made no efforts to coquette with anyone, had no
desire for social amusements?</p>

<p class='c001'>Wilmot had been frolicsome, roguish, winsome—did
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>Kate desire to eschew everything that had made her cousin
a sunbeam in the house, and the delight of her mother’s
heart, out of wilfulness, and determination not to please
her aunt, not to make up to her for the loss of her own
child?</p>

<p class='c001'>Not only by her aunt was Kate regarded as heartless and
perverse. That was the character she bore in the village,
among the girls of her own age, among the elders who
adopted the opinions of their daughters. Kate had been
brought in contact with the village girls at school, in the
choir, and elsewhere, and some had even attempted to
make friends with her. But those things which occupied
the whole souls of such young creatures—dress, the budding
inclination to attract the youths of the place—were
distasteful to Kate; there was nothing in common between
them and her, and when both became conscious of this,
they mutually drew apart, and the girls arrived at the same
conclusion as her aunt, that she was a dull, unfeeling child,
who was best left alone.</p>

<p class='c001'>Kate had felt acutely this solitariness in which she lived;
her aunt had often thrown it in her teeth that she made no
friends. Her father was displeased that he heard no good
report of his daughter; her uncle had rudely told her that
a girl who made herself so unpopular to her own sex would
never attract one of the other. Now the opportunity had
come to her to falsify his predictions, to gratify her father,
and to make her aunt proud—but she had rejected it, and was
more than ever alone. Loneliness was endurable ordinarily.
Kitty had her occupations, and, when not occupied, her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>thoughts, recently her book, to engross her; but now,
when her own relatives were against her it was more than
she could bear. The pain of desolation became insupportable.
There were but two persons she knew with whom
she was in touch, two persons only who could feel with and
for her, and to one of these she could not fly.</p>

<p class='c001'>The rector, whom she had loved and respected, was the
only friend to whom she could unburden her trouble, and
she feared to approach him, because she had just done
what he might not like, any more than did her uncle and
aunt. He would hear, and that speedily, of her conduct,
and Kate wished greatly to see him, and explain her
refusal to him as far as she could, that he might not blame
her. But even should her explanation prove unsatisfactory
to him, she was not prepared to withdraw her refusal.
Kate never wavered. She was one of those direct persons
who, when they have taken a course, hold to it persistently.</p>

<p class='c001'>She rose from her knees, bathed her face, brushed her
hair, and descended.</p>

<p class='c001'>Her aunt was in the kitchen, and averted her face as the
girl entered. She did not ask Kate where she was going,
nor turn her head to see what she was about.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I shall be back again in a few minutes, auntie; if you
can spare me, I should like to go out.”</p>

<p class='c001'>No answer; and Kate left.</p>

<p class='c001'>She had not taken many steps from the house, walking
with her head down, as the glare of the sun was too strong
for her tear-stung eyes, when she was caught, and before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>she could see in whose arms she was, she was boisterously
kissed.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You are a dear! you are a darling! I shall always love
you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Kitty saw before her Rose Ash, with glowing cheeks and
dancing eyes.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You darling! I never believed it of you, you are so
still. I thought you were sly. I am so sorry I misunderstood
you; so sorry I did anything or said anything against
you. I will never do it again. I will stand your friend; I
will fight your battles. And, look here!”</p>

<p class='c001'>A polished wood workbox was at her feet. She had put
it down for the purpose of disengaging her hands to hug Kate.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Look, Kitty! This is my own workbox. Is it not
beautiful? It has a mother-of-pearl escutcheon on it and
lock-plate. And it locks—really locks—not make-believe,
like some you buy. And, see! pink silk inside. It is for
you. I give it to you. It is nearly new. I am not much
of a needlewoman, and so have not used it. It is really a
hundred times better than that which Noah knocked—I
mean, that which the bear danced upon and smashed. And
there is a silver thimble in it. I give it you with all my
heart—that is to say, with as much heart as I have left to
give to anyone.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Kate stepped back in astonishment. What did this
mean?</p>

<p class='c001'>“O Kitty! you really shall no longer be Kitty Alone;
it shall be Kitty and Rose. We shall be regular friends.
Only think! I was so jealous of you. I thought that Jan
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>Pooke had taken a fancy to you—and I suppose the silly
noodle had done so for a bit, but you know he properly
belongs to me. We are to make a pair—everyone says so,
and his father and sister Sue wish it; and I’m sure, I’m
sure, so do I. But men are cruel giddy, they turn and
turn like weathercocks; and just for a while Jan fancied
you. But you put him off bravely, you did.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What have I done to you?” asked Kate.</p>

<p class='c001'>“My dear, I heard it all. I saw you and Jan going to
the orchard, and I was so jealous that I hid myself in the
linhay. I got over the hedge and tore my frock in a
bramble, but I did not heed it; I slipped in where I could
peep and see, and put out my ears and listen. I know
everything. I heard how you spoke up for me, and quite
right and reasonable too; and how you refused him, and
very sensible you was. Just think what a thing it would
ha’ been, Kitty, if he’d gone right off his head and married
you, and then come to his senses and found he had got the
wrong one, and it was me all along he should have had.
You would never have known happiness after. You never
would have enjoyed peace of conscience again. But you
were a sensible child, and did what you ought to ha’ done,
and nobody can’t do more than that; nor promise and vow
to do more than what is in the catechism. So, now, I’m all
for you, and there is my workbox I give you in place of
that the bear kicked to pieces. I don’t mind telling you
now, Kate, that Noah did it. I put him up to it; I told
him he was to do it. He didn’t like it, but I forced him
to it—I mean to knock the workbox from under your arm.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>He’s a good chap is Noah, and now that it is all put right
between Jan and me”—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Is it? Have you spoken with him?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh no, I can’t say that; but you have refused him. It
will take him a day or two to steady his head, and then he
will come up right again, and we will make it up, and be the
better friends in the end. And, what is more, I’ll stand
friend to you, Kate. I daresay you’d like Noah, and I’ll
get him to walk you out on Sundays and to sweetheart you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I don’t want Noah,” said Kate, shrinking.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh yes, you do. Every girl must have her young chap.
It ain’t natural without. I’ll speak with him. He’s a terrible
good chap is Noah; he’ll do anything I ask him. I made
him knock the workbox under the bear’s feet, and if he’d
do that much for me, I’m sure you need not be afraid
but he’d sweetheart you at my axing. Besides, he’ll be
tremendous thrown out when he sees me take up with Jan
again, and he’ll want some one to walk with, and may just
as well take you as another.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No; please, Rose, do not. I had rather be left alone.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Stuff and fiddlesticks! It is not right that you should
be without a sweetheart. You leave all that to me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, dear Rose, no. You be my friend; that suffices.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is because I am your friend that I will do a friend’s part.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, no, Rose.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, you always were queer; I can’t understand you.
But never mind; we are friends, though you make me a
helpless one. What is the good of a friend but to assist
a girl to a lover?”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXX <br /><span class='small'>UNDER THE MULBERRY TREE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c010'>Kate disengaged herself from Rose, and hastened to
the Rectory. She opened the garden gate. She
was a privileged person there, coming when she liked about
choir matters, sent messages by her uncle, who was churchwarden,
running in when she had a spare hour to look at
Mr. Fielding’s picture-books, in strawberry time to gather
the fruit and eat it, in preserving time to collect his raspberries,
currants, plums, for the cook to convert into
jams.</p>

<p class='c001'>She saw the rector sitting under a mulberry tree on his
lawn with a book on his lap. He had removed his hat,
and the spring air fluttered his silver hair.</p>

<p class='c001'>He saw Kate at once, and, smiling, beckoned to her to
come and sit by him on the bench that half encircled the old
tree.</p>

<p class='c001'>This she would not do, but she stood before him with
downcast eyes and folded hands, and said, “Please, sir, I
am afraid you will be cross with me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am never that, Kitty.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, sir, never.” She raised her flashing blue eyes for a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>moment. “Perhaps you may be vexed with me. I’ve just
gone and done clean contrary to what you said.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What did I say?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You said after my holiday I was to go home, and obey
my uncle and aunt in everything.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am sure I never said that.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It was something like it—be obliging and good.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, have you not been obliging and good?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, sir.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What have you done?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I’ve crossed them, and I fancy father will be cross
too.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What have you done to cross them?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Refused Jan Pooke.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The rector drew back against the tree and smiled.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Refused? I don’t quite understand.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Please, sir, Jan wanted to make me his wife.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And I said ‘No.’”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You had made up your mind already?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I knew I must say ‘No.’ Do you know, sir, Jan thought
that silver peninks came from daffodil roots.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh! and accordingly you could not say ‘Yes’?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It was silly; was it not?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And that was your real, true reason for saying ‘No’?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Kitty looked down.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You are not angry with me, sir?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No. Are your relations so?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes; uncle and aunt are dreadfully vexed, and that is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>what has made me cry. I came home wishing to do everything
to please them, and the first thing I did was to make
them angry and call me a little viper they had brought up
in their bosom. You do not think I did wrong? You are
not angry also?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No; I do not think you could have done otherwise, if
you did not care for John Pooke.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I did, and I do care for John Pooke.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then why did you not take him? Only because of the
silver peninks?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, sir; not that only. I care for him, but not enough;
I like him, but not enough.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Quite so. You like, but do not love him.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, that is it.” Kate breathed freely. “I did not
know how to put it. Do you think I did right?”</p>

<p class='c001'>The rector paused before he answered. Then he said,
signing with his thin hand, “Come here, little Kitty. Sit
by me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>He took her hand in his, and, looking before him, said,
“It would have been a great thing for this parish had you
become John Pooke’s wife, the principal woman in the
place, to give tone to it, the one to whom all would look up,
the strongest influence for good among the girls. I should
have had great hopes that all the bread I have strewed
upon the waters would not be strewn in vain.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I thought you wished it,” burst forth from the girl, with
a sob. “And yet I could not—I could not indeed. Now
I have turned everyone against me—everyone but Rose,”
she added, truthful in everything, exact in all she said.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>“No, Kitty, I do not wish it. It is true, indeed, that it
would be a rich blessing to such a place as this to have you
as the guiding star to all the womanhood in the place, set
up on such a candlestick as the Pookes’ farm. But I am
not so sure that the little light would burn there and not
be smothered in grease, or would gutter, and become extinguished
in the wind there. The place is good in itself,
but not good for you. It might be an advantage to the
parish, but fatal to yourself. John Pooke is an honest,
worthy fellow, and he has won my respect because he saw
your value and has striven to win you. But he is not the
man for you. For my little Kitty I hope there will come
some one possessed of better treasures than broad acres,
fat beeves, and many flocks of sheep; possessed of something
better even than amiability of temper.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What is that, sir?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“A well-stored intellect—an active mind. Kitty, no one
has more regard for young John than myself, but it would
have been terrible to you to have been tied to him. ‘Thou
shalt not plough with an ox and an ass together’ was the
command of Moses, and we must not unite under one
yoke the sluggish mind with that which is full of activity.
No, no, Kitty. You acted rightly. The man who will be
fitted to be coupled in the same plough with you will be
one of another mould. He will be”—</p>

<p class='c001'>The garden gate opened, and Walter Bramber entered.
A twig of laurel caught his sleeve, and he turned to extricate
himself, and did not perceive the rector and Kate. A
sudden confusion came over the girl, caused—whether by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>her thoughts, whether by the words of the rector, whether
from natural shyness, she could not tell, but she started
from the seat and slipped behind the mulberry.</p>

<p class='c001'>The schoolmaster came up to the rector when called,
and found the old man with a smile playing about his
lips.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have come, sir,” said Bramber, “to ask your advice.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“In private?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, sir, if you please.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then I cannot grant you an audience now. If you
will run round the mulberry, you will discover why.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Bramber was puzzled.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do what I say. There is someone there, someone who
must retire farther than behind a tree if you are to consult
me without being overheard.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The schoolmaster stepped aside to go about the mulberry,
and saw Kate standing there, leaning against the trunk,
holding together her skirts, and looking down.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh!” laughed Walter; “this is the audience! I do
not in the least mind a discussion of my concerns before
such an one.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Come out, Kitty! You hear your presence is desired,”
called Mr. Fielding, and the girl stepped forward. “Take
the place where you were before on one side of me, and
Mr. Bramber shall sit on the other, and we will enter on
the consideration of his affairs. What are they as to
complexion, Bramber, sanguine or atrabilious?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not cheerful, I am afraid. I have my troubles and
difficulties before my eyes.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>“So has Kitty. She comes to me from the same cause.”
Then he added, “Well, let us hear and consider.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It concerns Mr. Puddicombe. I do not know what I
ought to do, or whether I should do anything. There is
an organised opposition to me, and the late schoolmaster is
at the bottom of it. I can clearly perceive that not parents
only, but children as well, have been worked upon to offer
stubborn opposition to all my changes, and to make myself
ridiculous. I need not enter into details. There is this
feeling of antagonism in the place, and it paralyses me.
If the children were left unmanipulated, I could get along
and gain their confidence; but at home they hear what
their parents say, what is said to their parents, and they
come to school with a purpose not to obey me, not to
listen to my instructions, and to make my task in every
particular irksome and distasteful. I see precisely what
Puddicombe is aiming at—to force me to use the cane, not
once or twice, but continuously, and to force me to it by
making discipline impossible without it. Then he will
have a handle against me, and will rouse the parish to
hound me out. What am I to do?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Have you called on him?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, sir, I have not. I really could not pluck up
courage to do so. I hardly know what I could say to him
that is pleasant if we did meet.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You have not yet met him?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No. I do not know him by sight.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He is not a bad fellow; jovial, a sportsman at heart,
and his heart was never in the school; it was to be sought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>in the kennels, in stables, in the ring, anywhere save in
class. That was the blemish in the man. His thoroughness
was not where it should have been. His centre of gravity
was outside the sphere in which it was his duty to turn.
But he is not a bad fellow, good-hearted, placable, and only
your enemy because his vanity rather than his pocket is
touched by his dismissal. I hear he has announced his
intention of becoming a Dissenter; but as he hardly ever
came to church when he was professedly a Churchman, I
do not suppose chapel will see much of him when he
professes himself a Nonconformist. It is a great misfortune
when a man’s interests lie outside his vocation.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What shall I do, sir?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Call on him.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What shall I say to him?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Something that will please him—nothing about the
school; nothing about your difficulties.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am supremely ignorant of the cockpit and the race-course.
It is very hard when two men belonging to different
spheres meet; they can neither understand the
other.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“My dear young man, that is what I have been
experiencing these many years here; we must strive to
accommodate ourselves to inferior ways of thinking and
speaking, and then, then only, shall we be able to insinuate
into the gross and dark minds some spark of the higher life.
Kitty, have I your permission to tell Mr. Bramber what it
is that you have just communicated to me? It will be
public property throughout Coombe in half an hour, if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>everyone does not know it now, so it will be revealing no
secrets.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Kate looked, with a startled expression in her eyes, at the
rector. Why should he care to speak of this matter now?
Why before Bramber? But she had confidence in him,
and she did not open her lips in remonstrance.</p>

<p class='c001'>With a quiet smile, Mr. Fielding said: “You have not
yet heard the tidings with regard to our little friend here,
I presume?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Tidings—what?” The schoolmaster looked hastily
round and saw Kate’s head droop, and a twinkle come in
the rector’s eye. A slight flush rose to his temples.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Merely that she has received an offer”—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Offer?” Bramber caught his breath, and the colour
left his face.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Of marriage,” continued Mr. Fielding composedly.
“A most remarkable offer. The young man is eminently
respectable, very comfortably off; age suitable; looks
prepossessing; parents acquiescing.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Kate! Kitty!” Bramber’s voice was sharp with alarm
and pain.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I do not know whether the attachment has been one
of long continuance,” proceeded the rector. “The fact of
the proposal—now passing through Coombe—is like the
dropping of a meteorite in its midst. Popular fame had
attributed Rose Ash to John Pooke.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“John Pooke, is it?” gasped the schoolmaster, and he
sprang to his feet.</p>

<p class='c001'>“John Pooke the younger, not the father, who is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>widower of many years’ standing. The disparity of ages
makes that quite impossible. The younger John it is who
has aspired.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Kate, tell me—it cannot be. It must not be,” exclaimed
Bramber, stepping before the girl, and in his excitement
catching her hands and drawing them from her face, in
which she had hidden them. She looked up at him with a
flutter in her eyes and hectic colour in her cheeks. She
made no attempt to withdraw her hands.</p>

<p class='c001'>“By the way,” said the rector, “I will <a id='corr119.10'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='ook'>look</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_119.10'><ins class='correction' title='ook'>look</ins></a></span> up cockfighting
in my <cite>Encyclopædia Britannica</cite>, and make an
extract from the article, if I find one, that may be serviceable
to you, Bramber, when you call on Mr. Puddicombe.
I’ll go to my library. I shall not detain you many
minutes.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The many minutes were protracted to twenty. When
Mr. Fielding returned, the young people were seated close
to each other under the mulberry-tree, and still held hands;
their eyes were bright, and their cheeks glowing.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am sorry I have been so long,” said the rector; “but
there was a great deal of matter under the head of ‘Cock-pit’
in the <cite>Encyclopædia</cite>; and I had to run through it, and
cull what would be of greatest utility. I have written it
out. Do not rise. I will sit beside you—no, not between
you—listen! ‘It must appear astonishing to every reflecting
mind, that a mode of diversion so cruel and inhuman as
that of cockfighting should so generally prevail, that not
only the ancients, barbarians, Greeks, and Romans should
have adopted it; but that a practice so savage and heathenish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>should be continued by Christians of all sorts, and even
pursued in these better and more enlightened times.’ That
is how the article begins—very true, but won’t do for Mr.
Puddicombe. ‘The islanders of Delos, it seems, were great
lovers of cockfighting; and Tanagra, a city in B&oelig;otia, the
Isle of Rhodes, Chalcis in Eub&oelig;a, and the country of
Media, were famous for their generous and magnanimous
race of chickens.’ I don’t think this is much good.
Puddicombe, though a schoolmaster, will hardly know the
whereabouts of Delos, Tanagra, Rhodes, and Chalcis.
‘The cock is not only an useful animal, but stately in his
figure, and magnificent in his plumage. His tenderness
towards his brood is such, that, contrary to the custom of
many other males, he will scratch and provide for them
with an assiduity almost equal to that of the hen; and his
generosity is so great, that, on finding a hoard of meat, he
will chuckle the hens together, and, without touching one
bit himself, will relinquish the whole of it to them. He
was called <em>the bird</em>, κατ’ ἐξοχήν by many of the ancients’—But,
bless me, are you attending?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Mr. Fielding,” answered Bramber, “I do not think I
shall have much trouble in finding a topic on which to
speak with my predecessor in the school. He was Kitty’s
schoolmaster. She will introduce me to him. We will go
to him at once; and when he hears what we have to say,—that
I, the new schoolmaster, am going to take to me the
favourite, most docile, the best scholar of the old one; and
when he learns that he is the first person to whom we make
the announcement, and that he is at liberty to run up and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>down, and in and out of every house, communicating the
news,—why, I am pretty sure that he will be won.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, now!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And Kitty will cease to be Kitty Alone some time
next year.”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXXI <br /><span class='small'>ON MISCHIEF BENT</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c010'>When Pasco returned from Newton, he drew up his
tax-cart close to the door of the storehouse, took
the horse out, but did not unharness him; he merely
removed the bridle and gave the brute a feed.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then he entered the dwelling-house and seated himself
at the kitchen table without a word to his wife, and emptied
his pocket on the board. A couple of sovereigns and a few
shillings clinked together. With his forefinger he separated
the gold from the silver coins.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What! money come in, in place of going out?” asked
Zerah. Then, looking over his shoulder, she said, “And
precious little it is.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Little is better than nothing,” growled Pasco. “I got
this from Cole, the baker. I’d somehow forgot he owed
me a trifle, and he stopped me and paid his account. I
owe something to the miller, so I’m no better off than I
was. In at one pocket, out at the other.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Now look here, Pasco,” said his wife. “For first and
last I say this. I have laid by a trifle that I have earned
by cockles and winkles, whilst you have been chucking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>away in coals and wool. If you will pass me your word
not to run into extravagance, and not to listen to any more
of Jason’s schemes, I will let you have this. No”—she
corrected her intent; “you are not to be trusted with the
money. It shall not leave my hand to go into yours. And
your word ain’t of any strength, it is as weak as your
resolutions. I’ll settle the matter of the coals with the
merchant at Teignmouth; that is the great call at this
moment. I don’t do it for you, but to avoid the scandal
of having bailiffs in the house—a house where I’ve kept
myself respectable so many years, and where my Wilmot
was born and died. I wouldn’t have the brokers sell the
bed she laid on when dead, not for all my savings. So I’ll
over to Teignmouth and see what I can manage about the
coal merchant’s bill; and you, just take that money and
pay Ash the miller, and have done with him.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Again the thought rose up in the mind of Pasco that the
Evil One was making sport of him. At one time he was in
a condition of hopelessness, in another moment there was a
lightening in the sky before him. The means of striking
fire had been put into his hands at the same time that he
was shown that his difficulties were not insurmountable.
But the heart which has once resolved on a crime very
speedily comes to regard this object as a goal at which it
must necessarily aim, and to look with impatience upon all
suggestions of relief, upon all dissuasives, and stubbornly,
with shut eyes, to pursue the course determined on. The
struggle to form the determination once overpassed, the
mind shrinks from entering into struggle again, and allows
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>itself to be swept along as though impelled by fatality, as
though launched on a stream it is powerless to oppose.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now his wife’s suggestion that she should go to Teignmouth
and settle with the merchant for the coals opened
up to him a prospect, not of relief from his pecuniary
difficulty, but of getting rid of her to enable him the more
easily to carry out his intention unobserved. He put his
shaking hand into his breast-pocket for his handkerchief,
and in pulling this forth drew out also the lucifer match-box,
that in falling rattled on the table.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What have you there, Pasco?” asked Zerah.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nothing,” he answered, and hastily replaced the
box.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Don’t tell me that was nothing which I saw and heard,”
said his wife testily.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well—it’s lozenges.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Didn’t know you had a cough.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Never mind about that, Zerah,” said Pasco. “If you
go to Teignmouth it must be at once, or the tide will be out,
and I don’t see how you can get back to-night.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I’ve my cousin, Dorothy Bray, there. I’ll go to her.
I’ve not seen her some months, and she has a room. I’ll
leave Kitty at home now, to attend to the house, and you
won’t need me to the morning flow. I suppose, between
you, you can manage to light a fire?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Pasco started and looked at his wife with alarm, thinking
that she had read his thoughts; but he was reassured by
her changing the topic. “There—I’ll give you three pounds
towards the miller’s bill.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>Pepperill was now all anxiety to hurry his wife off. He
urged precipitancy on account of the falling tide. He bade
her row herself across, and leave the boat on the farther
shore till the next morning.</p>

<p class='c001'>His impatience in a measure woke her suspicion.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You seem mighty eager to get rid of me,” she said
querulously.</p>

<p class='c001'>“’Tain’t that, Zerah,” he answered; “but I want myself
to be off to Brimpts.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“To Brimpts?—and leave Kitty alone in the house?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No; I shall take her with me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What!—leave the house to take care of itself?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What can harm it? No one will break in. They know
pretty well there is nothing to be got but bills that ain’t
paid.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I don’t half like it—and the stores?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There is no moving wool or coals without waggons, and
I shall lock up.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Zerah stood in uncertainty.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I wish you’d not go, Pasco.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I may or may not—but be off, or you’ll get stuck in the
mud, as did Kitty.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In ten minutes Pasco was alone. He stood on the
platform where were the tea-tables and benches, and watched
till his wife was half-way across. Then he drew a long
breath, and passed through the house, went out at the main
door, and hastened to the cart. Again he stood still, and
looked searchingly in every direction; then he let down
the flap behind, drew out first the sack of shavings and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>carried it within, and then he cleared out all that remained.
He was not satisfied till with a broom he had swept every
particle of chip within, leaving not a tell-tale white atom
without. Then he tacked some scraps of sacking over the
window that no one might look within, and he proceeded
to place bundles of the shavings among the coals, not in one
great heap, but dispersed in handfuls here and there, and
he broke up some pieces of board into splinters and thrust
them among the shavings.</p>

<p class='c001'>He was startled by a voice calling in the door, “Uncle,
are you here?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Hot, agitated, and alarmed, Pasco hastened to the
entrance, and saw Kate.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What do you want? Why are you shouting?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Where is aunt? I want to see her. I cannot find her
in the house. I have something to tell her.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You are not like to find her,” said Pepperill, coming
outside and locking the door behind him. “She is gone
over the water, and will stay at Cousin Bray’s; and I’m off
to Brimpts again, and mean to take you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why, uncle! we have but just returned from
there.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, that’s no concern of yours, where you are, so
long as you have your eatin’ and drinkin’. I must go, and
your aunt thinks I mustn’t leave you alone. So be sharp;
run and put what things you require together, and I will
harness the cob.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“How long shall we be away, uncle?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“We shall be back to-morrow evening, or the day after.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>I can’t say. Come, be quick. I can’t wait talking with you;
it is late already.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Kate obeyed, a little surprised. She speedily returned,
with her little bundle tied up in a scarlet kerchief.</p>

<p class='c001'>Pasco was ready and waiting. He was looking up at the
drift of the clouds. The wind was from the east and
blowing strongly.</p>

<p class='c001'>Pepperill drove through the village. He halted at the
public-house to call out the taverner, ask for a glass of ale,
and tell him he was bound for Dartmoor. At the mill he
again drew up, and shouted for the miller, who, on emerging
from his door, saluted Pasco with the remark, “Why, you
are on the road to-day a great deal. I thought you had gone
this way already.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“So I had—to Newton; but there I learned something.
The Government has come round to a reasonable mind,
and will buy my timber. Not at Devonport, but at Portsmouth;
and I am going to measure up. I ran home to
tell my old woman. And now, by the way, I will settle that
little account between us, if agreeable to you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Always right with me to receive,” said the miller.</p>

<p class='c001'>Pasco drew out a handful of money and discharged his
debt. “Just receipt it, will you, with the date, and say what
o’clock in the afternoon also—that there may be no mistake.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You are not going to Brimpts to-night?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, I am. Business must be attended to.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Rather late for the little maid by the time you get there.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That can’t be helped—she is strong now.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then Pepperill drove on. He continued his course
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>without interruption, as the country he passed through was
sparsely populated.</p>

<p class='c001'>Kate’s heart was full. She was in doubt whether to tell
her uncle that which had taken place between herself and
Walter Bramber. She would greatly have preferred to have
made the communication to her aunt and let her inform
Mr. Pepperill. She was afraid of Pasco. He was violent
and brutal. Her aunt was merely harsh. Pasco had been
very angry with her for refusing Jan Pooke, and she did not
believe that he would receive with favour the communication
she had to make relative to the schoolmaster. She dreaded
another outburst. Yet her strong sense of duty pressed her
to communicate to him what he must learn within a short
time, from other lips if not from her own. Then ensued a
painful struggle in her breast, and she was constrained to
free herself at length, and to say—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Uncle, you know I refused Jan Pooke, but since then,
what I could not say to him I have said to Walter Bramber,
the schoolmaster.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, ah! Jan Pooke—yes, to be sure.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, not Jan, but the schoolmaster.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Drat it!” exclaimed Pasco, stroking his head; “I’ve
forgotten to lock up the house. I let the door stand as it
was when you came out. Now anyone can go in and take
what they like, break into my bureau and steal my money,
get hold of Zerah’s silver spoons. I say, Kitty, jump out
and open that field-gate. There is a linhay there. I’ll put
up the trap and horse, and you shall wait by ’em whilst I
run back to Coombe Cellars and lock the house.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>“But how is aunt to get in when she returns?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You be easy. I’ll put the key in the little hole over the
lintel. She knows where to find it. Look alive, jump and
open the gate. Drat it! what a way I shall have to run!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why not drive back, uncle?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why not?—Because the cob must be spared. I’ve
been into Newton already to-day, and the distance he has
to go is just about enough to rub his hoofs down.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Pepperill drove the cart into the field indicated, whilst
Kate held wide the gate. Then he took the cob out and
ran the cart under cover.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You keep in shelter, and mind you do not show yourself.
If anyone pass along the road, be still as a mouse.
Never mind who it may be. I shall be gone perhaps an
hour, perhaps a little more. It will be dark before I am
back. You keep close. There is some straw in the corner,
lie on that and go to sleep. We have still a long journey
to take, and get on we must, through the night, and this is
a darned matter detaining me. Hush!”</p>

<p class='c001'>They heard something like a cart rattling along.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Git along, Neddy! ‘If I had a donkey ’wot wouldn’t
go’—you know the rest, Neddy.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is my father, I believe,” said Kate.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I don’t believe it is. Anyhow, be still,” whispered
Pasco. “Your father is at Brimpts. He can’t be returned
here. It’s some other chap with a donkey.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The sound of the wheels was lost, as at the point where
they had turned in at the gate there was a sweep in the
road between high hedges and overarching trees.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>“I think it was father,” said Kate.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And I say it was not. However, whoever it was, he’s
gone now. You bide here. I’m off—mind don’t be seen
or heard by nobody till my return.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then Pasco departed.</p>

<p class='c001'>He did not take the way by the road. He crossed the
field, scrambled over a hedge, and directed his course
towards the river. This was not the shortest way, and it
was certainly the most arduous, for it entailed the breaking
through of several hedges, and the scrambling over many
banks.</p>

<p class='c001'>The evening was rapidly closing in.</p>

<p class='c001'>He saw—or heard—the keeper, and crouched under a
hedge, holding his breath. Happily for him, the man
passed at some distance. His dog barked, but was called
to heel, and Pasco did not venture from his lurking-place
till ten minutes after the man had gone his <a id='corr130.17'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='way,'>way.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_130.17'><ins class='correction' title='way,'>way.</ins></a></span> Then he
sprang up and ran, and did not relax his pace till he had
reached the river bank, having first floundered through a
backwater deep in mire. On the bank was a foot-path,
somewhat frequented by lovers at dusk, and Pasco advanced
along it stealthily, listening and peering before him at
intervals, to make certain that no one approached.</p>

<p class='c001'>The tide was out, the mud exhaled its peculiar and not
pleasant odour. Something flopped into it near at hand—whether
a bird had dropped, or a stone had been flung, or
a flounder had been left by the tide, and beat the mud with
his tail, Pasco could not tell. The sound sent the blood
with a rush to his heart and turned him sick and giddy.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>Looking at him over a rail was a white horse. He did
not see it until close upon the bank, and then the apparition
of the great head turning to him and rubbing its chin on the
rail gave him another start, and he almost slipped into the
mud beside the path.</p>

<p class='c001'>At length he reached the field adjoining the spit of land
on which stood Coombe Cellars; here the path turned
towards the village, but there was a way through the hedge
to his own house. Pasco took this track, emerged in front
of the Cellars, and found the door open, a light shining
through the window of his kitchen and Jason Quarm inside.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXXII <br /><span class='small'>JASON IN THE WAY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c010'>Jason had lighted a candle, and had made himself
comfortable in the settle. Pepperill stood staring at
him in speechless anger and uncertainty.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Where’s the sister? Where’s Kitty?” asked Jason in
unconcern.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What are you doing here?” roared Pasco, convulsed
with sudden rage. “Is this your house, that you dare come
in and use it as your home?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Quarm looked at his brother-in-law in surprise.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Get out of the place at once,” shouted Pasco. “If I
happen to go away for ten minutes, is that a reason for
every Jack and Tom to come here, as if it was ‘Beggars’
Hall’?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why, what on earth has put you out?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What has put me out? you—by coming in here. This
is my house, not yours.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Brother-in-law,” said Jason, puzzled at the strange
humour of Pasco, “is not that a sufficient answer, when I
give you that title? Zerah is my sister—I have ever been
welcome here. Kate is my daughter—she lives with you.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>Why am I here? Put it—I have come to see my sister,
come to kiss my child.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Neither is in the house.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then where are they?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am not bound to answer you,” shouted Pepperill in
anger, vexation, and fear, aggravated by the coolness with
which Quarm answered him.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, you are. I have ties of blood, and ties of affection,
your bad temper can’t snap. I ask, where is my
daughter?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Gone back to the moor.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That can’t be—alone.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“She is not alone.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Is Zerah with her?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, she is not; Zerah is at Teignmouth, gone there to
get me out of one of the difficulties into which you have
plunged me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I—I got you into difficulties? I am always showing
you rope’s-ends by which you may crawl out.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Who else but yourself has now put me in such an upsetment
that I do not know under what stone to look for
money; that I’m threatened with legal proceedings; that
the bailiffs are on the way to my house?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is your own doing, not mine. Who threatens
you?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There is my bill for the wool unmet. There is my
account for coals unpaid.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have had to do with neither. You acted like a fool
about Coaker’s wool—buying when in all the papers it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>told how that there had been an importation from New
South Wales.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I never read the papers.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then you have no right to do business. You do it at
inevitable loss. But this is neither here nor there, above
nor below. Where is Kate?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have told you—gone to the moor.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“When?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“An hour or two ago.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“With whom?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“With me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then how came you here?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Because I had left the doors unlocked against impertinent
fellows coming in. I left Kate with the trap
whilst I ran back. Now, are you content? Out of my
house immediately. I want to lock up and go back to her.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“This is a queer tale,” said Quarm. “I have myself
but just arrived. I must have passed you on the way.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not at all, if we had gone into a friend’s for a cup of
tea.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“With what friends were you?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I shall not stand and be catechised by you. I say, get
out. I am going to lock up.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Now look here, Pasco, and be reasonable. I would
not have returned to Coombe and left the men at Dart-meet
unlooked after, had I not good news to communicate.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Good news?” mocked Pepperill. “The best of news
would be that you were going to take yourself off.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I believe we shall sell the oak.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>“I have heard of that already—from Coaker.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, I tell you it is so. The authorities at Portsmouth
will take it at a reasonable price, if we deliver it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There is the thing we can’t do—that spoils it all.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, we can—deliver it here in the Teign. There is
the Stover Canal—we can send it down by that and ship it
all to Portsmouth right away.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Pepperill was silent. This was indeed a rift in the cloud.
“The only difficulty is not this—it is that we must have
the timber sawn at Brimpts, and sent down and put on
board in planks. They cannot freight a vessel with rude
oak timber unsawn. Now I have a scheme—there is the
river Dart pouring down its volumes of water of no good
to anyone. Let us put up a saw-mill, and we shall have
the oak run into planks and ready for transport in a
jiffy.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And the cost?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Forty pounds.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Forty pounds?” roared Pasco, and thrust Quarm from
him by a rude stroke on the shoulder. “Where am I to
look for forty pence?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is our only chance. I must agree to-morrow, or the
thing is off. If I engage to saw up the timber and despatch
it by water, we shall get a very tidy profit—not what we
had hoped, but something. If I do not accept the offer,
then I really do not see my way to disposing of the oak
at all. The felling of the Okehampton Park oaks has
spoiled the market in this country. Come, what say you,
Pasco—shall I settle?”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>“I cannot do it,” answered Pepperill, a cold sweat breaking
out over his brow.</p>

<p class='c001'>“There is an old mine wheel available. I can buy it
for a song,” said Quarm.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have no money. Have I not told you that—or
must I knock it into your brain with my fist—or the house
key?” He raised his hand threateningly.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Be reasonable, Pasco. I cannot tell what has come
over you to-night. You are not yourself. If you do not
care about the outlay for a saw-mill, we must saw all up
by hand, and that will come costlier in the end. I fancy
if you bestirred yourself you could raise a loan.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I will not. I will have but one thing now—your
absence. Get out of my house!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Where be I to go to?” asked Quarm, settling himself
from one leg to the other. “There’s Jane Redmore in my
cottage, with all her children.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well”—</p>

<p class='c001'>“I can’t go there—the place is full.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You are a fool to have suffered it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Kate begged and prayed of me”—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Take the consequences, and be homeless.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I cannot, for to-night. You are going to Brimpts, and
it is as well the men should see you. I shall return to-morrow,
but to-night I must house me somewhere. Let
me stay here; there is no one in the place, and I’ll keep
guard for you if you wish.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There is nothing here to guard, but emptiness. I
want no help of yourn.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>“But I must have a roof over my head at night.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Any roof but mine. Will you go, or must I fling you
out and down the steps?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You’re in a wonderful queer temper to-night. What is
up?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“My temper, as you say, is up; and like to be so—when
it is through you I am brought to ruin and beggary.”</p>

<p class='c001'>He caught Jason by the shoulders, whirled him round,
and with hands and knees thrust him out of the door, and
then he slammed it behind him and turned the key. Next
moment he blew out the light. Then he threw himself
panting on the settle and buried his head in his hands.</p>

<p class='c001'>He had not sat there many minutes before Quarm was
kicking at the door, and calling him by name. Transported
with anger, Pasco sprang to his feet, took down the
blunderbuss that was over the kitchen fire, and, going to
the door, half opened it and thrust forth the muzzle of
his piece.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Go away, or I will shoot.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“This is rank folly!” bawled Jason. “Are you gone
demented? Give me shelter for the night; I will do no
harm. What do you mean by refusing me such a reasonable
request? I tell you I can’t go home—all the Redmores
are there packing every corner.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Jason thrust up the end of the blunderbuss, and put his
shoulder to the door.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I’ll kill you if you trouble me further,” said Pasco
between his teeth. “Take the consequences of befriending
scoundrels and their families.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>He drove Quarm back and refastened the door, then
he stood at the door listening, with the butt of the gun on
his foot. He heard his brother-in-law growl and pass
remarks upon him. He heard him limp away, and then
all was still.</p>

<p class='c001'>Pepperill stepped to a window and looked out, to
observe the direction taken by Quarm, but the darkness
was too great for him to see anything. He went back to
the settle and tried to think.</p>

<p class='c001'>The elaborate precautions he had taken to dissemble
his return, to make believe that he had departed before
sunset, had been made futile by the appearance of Jason
on the scene. Should what he purposed take place—then
he could not declare that he had been from home at the
time. What availed it that he had paid the miller’s bill
at a quarter to seven, when his brother-in-law could aver
that he had been back at the Cellars an hour later?</p>

<p class='c001'>What was to be done? Should he abandon his intention
because of this mischance? Rage against his brother-in-law
ate into his heart. All had promised so well.
Everything was moving with such smoothness, till Quarm
appeared. What but a malevolent mind could have
brought this fellow back from Brimpts to cross him?</p>

<p class='c001'>What was to be done? It was of no practical use
storming against Jason. Should he abandon his purpose
or defer it?</p>

<p class='c001'>To abandon it seemed to him an impossibility. By
carrying it out alone could he be released from his present
pecuniary difficulty. To defer it was difficult, for he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>wanted immediate relief; moreover, when again could he
calculate on having the ground so clear now—his wife as
away in Teignmouth, his niece waiting at a distance with
the cart?</p>

<p class='c001'>What if Jason had seen him? Would he dare to give
evidence against him—his own brother-in-law? Was it
not to Jason’s interest that he, Pasco, should be flush of
money, and ready to embark in the proposed scheme of
erecting a saw-mill?</p>

<p class='c001'>Even if Jason spoke of having seen him, he could deny
it. Pasco sprang from the settle. He would run the risk.
It was worth it.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXXIII <br /><span class='small'>ONE CRIME LEADS TO ANOTHER</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c010'>Pasco remained in the dark in his house for about
half an hour, waiting till he supposed that Jason
was far away. He allowed him time to harness his ass,
put it into the cart, and depart. He went once or twice
to the door to listen, but did not venture to open it, lest
Jason should be without, and should take advantage of the
occasion to burst in. He remained all the while bathed in a
clammy sweat, his hair stuck to his skull as though plastered
about his temples with fish-glue, he felt it heavy and dank
on his head like a cap.</p>

<p class='c001'>Repeatedly did he try to collect his thoughts and to
coolly consider whether it were not advisable for him,
under the circumstances, to abandon his scheme. But
his thoughts were in a condition of dislocation, he could
not gather them and fit them together into consecutive
order. He felt himself impelled, having formed his resolve,
to proceed with it, and to leave to the future the removal
of such difficulties as might spring up, as came in his
way.</p>

<p class='c001'>He was restless, yet afraid to be stirring. He was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>impatient for the time to pass, and counted the ticks of
the clock, yet forgot after a few minutes the number he
had reached.</p>

<p class='c001'>The seat was hard and bruised him, he leaned back,
and his back ached. He held out his hand, placed it on
the table and endeavoured to steady it. He was aware
that it shook, and he used all the power of his will to arrest
its convulsive quiver, but ineffectually. At length, unable
longer to endure inaction, and convinced that sufficient
time had elapsed for his brother-in-law to have got away,
he cautiously unlocked the door and looked out.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the dark he could see no one; he listened and could
hear no sound.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then he stepped back to the kitchen table and removed
the candle-end from the stick, and put it into his pocket.
No sooner had he reached the door again, however, than
it occurred to him that a candlestick without a tallow
candle in it, if left on the table, would attract attention and
comment. He therefore returned for it, and placed it
on the mantelshelf above the hearth. In doing this he
knocked over a canister that fell at his feet. He groped
and found the canister; the cover had come off, and some
of the contents were spilled. This was gunpowder.
Greatly disconcerted, Pasco felt for a brush and swept all
the grains he could into the hollow of his hand, and shook
them into his trousers-pocket, then he swept the brush
vigorously about, so as to disperse over the floor any particles
that had escaped him in the dark. After which he proceeded
carefully to replace the canister. He now again
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>made his way to the door, passed without, locked the door
behind him, and placed the key in a hollow above the
lintel, known to Zerah and himself.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then he stealthily crossed the yard to his great warehouse,
but at every second step turned his ears about,
listening for a sound which might alarm him.</p>

<p class='c001'>He did not breathe freely till he was within his store.
He had not locked it—indeed, of late he had been wont
to leave it unfastened, labouring under the hope that the
hint thrown out to Roger Redmore might be taken by
the fellow, thus relieving himself of his self-imposed
task.</p>

<p class='c001'>Without, there was a little light from the grey sky.
Within was none. What amount might have found its
way in through the window was excluded by the sacking
that Pasco had nailed over the opening.</p>

<p class='c001'>He now proceeded to light his candle end. When the
wick was kindled, he looked about him timidly, then with
more confidence; lastly with a sensation of great regret
and even pity for the fabric in which he had so long stored
his supplies that he retailed to the neighbourhood.</p>

<p class='c001'>But no thought of retreat came over his mind now, he
was impelled forward irresistibly. The doubt was past
that had tortured him, after his interview with Jason
Quarm.</p>

<p class='c001'>He stuck the candle-end upon the ground, and went
about among the coals, examining the places where he had
put the shavings, adding here and there some bits of stick,
or rearranging the coals, and then strewing over them the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>contents of his out-turned pocket. Then he sat down and
panted. He must rest a moment and wipe his brow before
the irrevocable act was accomplished.</p>

<p class='c001'>Presently, slowly, painfully, he rose from the block of
coal on which he had seated himself. The sack lay hard
by into which he had stuffed the shavings. It was now
empty.</p>

<p class='c001'>He took up the candle-end and went towards the nearest
mass of shavings, stooped—the grease ran over his fingers.
The wick had become long and the flame burnt dull. He
thought to snuff it with his fingers, but they shook too
much to be trusted. He might extinguish the flame, and
he shuddered at the thought of being left there—in his old
storehouse—in the dark. He again set down the candle,
and with a bit of stick beat the red wick, and struck off
sparks from it, till he had somewhat reduced the length of
the snuff.</p>

<p class='c001'>He was about to take up the candle to apply it to the
shavings, when he heard a sound—a strange grating,
rattling sound behind him.</p>

<p class='c001'>He looked round, but could see nothing, his great body
was between the light and the rear of the shed, whence the
sound proceeded. He was too much alarmed to perceive
the cause of the obscurity. Then he heard a voice—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Pasco, I never thought you a scoundrel till now—but
now I know it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Pepperill recognised the voice at once—it was that of
Jason Quarm.</p>

<p class='c001'>Immediately he realised the situation. Expelled from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>Coombe Cellars, debarred from sheltering in his own house,
Quarm had entered the store-shed, and had climbed the
ladder into the loft to lie among the wool, and there
sleep.</p>

<p class='c001'>A sudden wild, fierce thought shot through Pasco’s brain
like the flash of summer lightning. He sprang to his feet.
The terror that had momentarily unnerved him passed
away. Leaving the candle burning on the ground, without
a word, he strode to the ladder, which Quarm was descending
laboriously, owing to his lameness.</p>

<p class='c001'>With clenched teeth and contracted brow, and with every
muscle knotted like cord, Pepperill threw himself on the
ladder, just as Jason got his head below the opening of the
loft, and shook it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“For Heaven’s sake! what are you about?” screamed
Jason.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I’ll rid myself of a danger,” answered Pasco between
his teeth and lips, indistinctly, and he twisted the ladder,
and kicked at its feet to throw it down.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Pasco, let go! Pasco, will you kill me?” shrieked the
crippled man, catching ineffectually at the floor through
which he had crawled, then clutching the side of the
ladder.</p>

<p class='c001'>Pepperill uttered an oath; he ran under the ladder, set
his back against it and kicked with his heels.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Pasco! I’ll not tell—I swear!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I won’t give you the chance,” gasped Pepperill. The
ladder was reeling, sliding, the feet were slipping on the
slate floor. A piercing scream, and down came ladder and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>man upon Pasco, throwing him on his knees, but precipitating
the unfortunate cripple with a crash on the
pavement.</p>

<p class='c001'>Pepperill, though shaken and bruised, was not seriously
hurt. He gathered himself up, stretched his limbs, felt his
arms, and with lowering brow stepped towards his prostrate
brother-in-law, who lay on his back, his arms extended, the
hands convulsively contracted. His chin was up, and the
dim glow of the candle cast its light below the chin, and
had no rays for the upper portion of the face.</p>

<p class='c001'>Pepperill felt in his pocket for the lucifer matches, and,
stooping over Quarm, lit one, and passed the flame over his
countenance. Jason was apparently insensible. Blood
was flowing from his mouth at the corners. The flame of
the match was reflected in the white of the upturned
eyes.</p>

<p class='c001'>Pasco held the match till it burnt his fingers, then he let
it fall, and remained considering for a moment. Should
he let his brother-in-law lie where he was? Could he be
sure that he would not awake from a momentary daze
caused by the blow on his head as he fell on the stone
floor?</p>

<p class='c001'>Pasco picked up a huge lump of coal and stood over
Jason, ready to dash it down on his head, and make sure
of his not awaking. But though his heart was hard, and
he was launched on a course of crime, yet conscience
makes strange distinctions in crime, and shrinks from doing
boldly the evil at which it aims covertly.</p>

<p class='c001'>Pasco laid aside the block of coal. He would not dash
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>out his brother-in-law’s brains, but he would by other means
make sure that he should not rouse to give him future
trouble.</p>

<p class='c001'>He took the sack, in which had been the shavings, and
proceeded to thrust into it the legs of Quarm, who offered
no more resistance than would a dead man, and gave no
sign of consciousness. With much labour, Pasco drew the
sack up, enclosing the body; he pulled down the arms and
forced them into the sack also. But he was unable to
envelop Jason completely. The sack was not of sufficient
length for the purpose. It reached to his breast and
elbows only.</p>

<p class='c001'>There was a rope hanging in the store to a crook in the
wall. Pepperill disengaged this, and with the cord bound
Jason’s feet, then tightly strapped him about the arms so as
to make it impossible for him to free himself, should he
return to consciousness.</p>

<p class='c001'>The exertion used by Pasco had steadied his nerves.
He no longer trembled. His hand had ceased to shake,
and his heart no longer contracted with fear.</p>

<p class='c001'>Greatly heated by his labour, he stood up and wiped his
brow with his sleeve. Then he was aware of a cool current
of air wafting across him, and he saw that in this same
current the candle-flame consumed its wick and swaled
away profusely. He turned in the direction of the draught,
and found that the door into the shed was partly open.
He had not locked it when he entered, but had closed it.
The night wind had swung it ajar, and then by its own
weight it had opened farther. Pepperill shut it again, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>placed a lump of coal against the foot to prevent a recurrence
of the same thing.</p>

<p class='c001'>As he returned to where Jason lay, he heard a slight noise
overhead, and saw a white and black pigeon perched on a
swinging pole.</p>

<p class='c001'>The bird was young. It had been given to Pasco the
week before, as he had expressed a wish to have pigeons.
He had shut the bird up in his shed to accustom it to
regard the shed as its home, and to remain there. He had
fed the bird himself with crumbs, and had entertained an
affection for it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now a qualm came over his heart. He could not bear
to think of this innocent bird falling a victim. He had
compunction for the pigeon, none for the unconscious
Jason. Therefore, rolling a barrel under the perch, he
climbed upon it, captured the sleep-stupid bird and carried
it between his hands to the door, pushed aside the lump
of coal, and threw the pigeon into the open air
without.</p>

<p class='c001'>That act of mercy accomplished, he shut the door and
went back to where the candle was. This he now detached
from the floor and the mass of melted tallow around it, and
applied the flame to one, then to another, of the little
parcels of combustibles in various places. Flames danced
about, and for a minute Pasco looked on with satisfaction,
assuring himself that the shavings had ignited the sticks,
and the sticks had kindled the coals. When well satisfied
that all was as he desired, he knelt down, and by sheer
force rolled the heavy, lifeless body of Jason Quarm from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>the floor, up the slope of the coals, and lodged it among
large blocks on the top.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then Pepperill turned, extinguished his candle, went
out through the door, locked it, and started at a run across
the fields in the direction whence he had come an hour
before.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXXIV <br /><span class='small'>AND YET ANOTHER</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c010'>Pasco ran on, easily surmounting the hedges which he
had clambered over with difficulty on his way to
Coombe Cellars. He reached the track by the water’s
edge, and ran along that without once looking behind him,
and only paused when he arrived at the point at which he
must strike inland, to his left, leaving the river margin to
ascend the sloping shaws in the direction of the shed where
tarried Kitty with cob and cart. Here he halted, and a
chill ran through his arteries, making him shiver and his
teeth chatter. He was hot with running, yet withal in an
icy tremor, and with a feeling of swimming in his head and
sickness at his heart.</p>

<p class='c001'>The thought had risen up in him, an almost tangible
thought, like a great beast coiled in his heart, stretching
itself, getting on its feet, and turning. The thought was
this—that it was not too late to save his brother-in-law.
He might return, unlock the store, rush in, and drag the
unconscious man down from the heap of coals, through the
smoke and flame. The fire had not yet reached him; it
was tonguing up the heap, sending the tips of its flames
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>tastingly towards him; the fire was hot beneath, but the
crust still upheld the man in the sack; would it be so
much longer? As the coals were consumed beneath, there
would be formed a great core of red fire, and if Jason
moved, the crust would give way, and then, shrieking,
unable to assist himself, he would drop into that glowing
mass, where the cords would be burnt to free him, but only
when it would be too late for him to escape.</p>

<p class='c001'>Had Jason already woke from his trance, and was he
cuddled up in his sack, watching the approaching flames,
crying for help, and getting none? Was he tearing at his
bands with his teeth, writhing—trying to precipitate himself
down the black mound of combustible material, in the
hopes of being able to roll along the floor to the door?
And if he succeeded so far—what more could he do?
Nothing but watch the fire grow, break out in gushes of
scarlet and orange, pour forth volumes of stifling smoke,
and then lie with his mouth below the door, gasping for
the air that rushed in beneath.</p>

<p class='c001'>Shuddering, Pasco Pepperill stood with eyes open, looking
into the night, seeing all this as really as though the
vision were unrolled before his naked eyes. He dared not
look behind him, his neck was stiff, and he could not turn
it—he could not even turn his eyes in the direction of the
Cellars.</p>

<p class='c001'>Should he retrace his course and free Jason? Could he
not rely on Jason to remain silent after this terrible experience?
But what if he arrived too late? What if the fire
had already broken out, and had laid hold of its prey?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>Why should he give himself the lasting horror of seeing
what he must then see? And of what avail would it be to
the burning man?</p>

<p class='c001'>It was too late. Pasco had taken his line, had cast his
lot, and there was no return. He resumed his run up the
hill, through the meadows; the wind blowing off the river
assisted him. When he reached the field in which was the
shed, he knew that Coombe Cellars was no longer visible.
There was a shoulder of hill between.</p>

<p class='c001'>But though the Cellars might not be visible, the sky
overhead might show redness, might throb with light; and
lest he should see this, he fixed his eyes resolutely in an
opposite direction.</p>

<p class='c001'>In crossing the field he no longer ran. He had lost his
breath ascending the hill; he walked slowly, panting, and
ever and anon stopped to wipe his brow, and remove his
hat, that the cool wind might play about his wet hair.</p>

<p class='c001'>The qualm of conscience relative to Jason was overpassed,
and now Pepperill congratulated himself on his
success. Now—all was as could be desired, there was
nothing to inculpate him, no one to turn evidence against
him, except—</p>

<p class='c001'>There was one person, and one only, who was a danger to
Pasco; one person, and one only, who knew that he had
been to Coombe Cellars after having ostensibly left it; one,
and one only, that he had been on the spot precisely at the
time when, presumably, the fire broke out.</p>

<p class='c001'>If Kate Quarm were to speak, then what he had done
was done in vain; the Company would refuse to pay the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>sum for which his stock was insured, and he might be suspected
of having caused the death of his brother-in-law.
Would not Kate speak—when she knew that her father
was dead? Might she not make dangerous admissions
should there be an inquest? The charred corpse or burnt
bones would be discovered when the ashes of the store
were removed, and Jason’s cart and ass being in Coombe,
would lead to the conclusion that he, Jason Quarm, had
caused the conflagration and had perished in it. It would
be supposed that he had gone to the Cellars, and, finding it
locked and no one within, had taken shelter for the night in
the warehouse, where he had lit his pipe, gone to sleep, and
inadvertently had set fire to the coals and wool.</p>

<p class='c001'>But then—what might Kate be brought to say if
questioned by the coroner?</p>

<p class='c001'>Pepperill entered the shed and called the girl. He called
twice before he received an answer. Then he struck a
light, and as the match flared he saw before him the drowsy
face of Kate.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, uncle! What a long time you have been away!
I fell asleep.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Long time? I have not been a quarter of an hour. I
ran to the Cellars and ran back the whole way.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It has been more than a quarter of an hour, Uncle
Pasco. I waited, watching for ever such a time, and then
I went to sleep.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You are mistaken. Because you shut your eyes you
think the time was long.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What is that, uncle, you are burning?”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>“A lucifer match.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“How did you get it alight?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“By striking it on the box.”</p>

<p class='c001'>"How could that light it? Is there a bit of tiny flint on
the match and steel on the box?</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, there is not. I don’t know how the fire comes—but
it comes somehow.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That must be a very curious contrivance, uncle.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Whether curious or not is no concern of yours.”</p>

<p class='c001'>He struck another match and held it aloft. The girl
stood on one side of the cart, he on the other. The lucifer
flame twinkled in her eyes. Her hair was ruffled with
sleep.</p>

<p class='c001'>As Pasco looked at her by the dying flame, he was considering
what to do. He had no doubt that he was
insecure so long as she lived. Desperate, hardened, projected
along an evil course, could he withhold his hand
now and not make himself secure? Would it not be
weakness as well as folly to allow this testimony to remain
who could at any moment reveal his guilt? But if he were
to strike her down with a stake or stone, what could he do
with the body?</p>

<p class='c001'>“Take care, uncle,” said Kate. “There is dry furze
here. If the spark falls, there may be a blaze.”</p>

<p class='c001'>He extinguished the match with his fingers. He did not
desire that his course should be marked by fires.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Is there much furze here, Kitty?” he asked in a
smothered voice.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh no! only just under foot.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>“No great heap in a corner?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“None, uncle.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not enough to cover you over if you were asleep.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Kate laughed and answered, “I would never lie on furze
if I could help it, and be covered with it—I should be
tormented with prickles. I sat down and laid my head
against the hedge that makes the back of the linhay.” He
was prodding the bedding of furze with his whip. “It is
all fresh,” said Kate. “I reckon Miller Ash is going to
turn his cow in here, when he has taken away her calf.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah! she has calved?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes; last week.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“True—the cow will be here to-morrow, or in a couple
of days.” To himself he muttered, “It won’t do”—then
aloud, “Jump into the cart, Kitty. We must push on.
You drive out, I will open the gate.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In another minute Pasco Pepperill was in his seat with
Kitty at his side, driving in the direction away from the
Cellars.</p>

<p class='c001'>He feared every moment to hear her say, “Uncle, what
is that light shining over Coombe? Can there be a
fire?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Instead of that she said, “Uncle, did you see nothing
of my father? I am quite sure that was he who drove by
after we had got into Mr. Ash’s field. I heard his voice.
I know his way with the donkey. I am quite certain that
was father.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Your father?—no. Never set eyes on him. You were
mistaken.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>“I am sure it was my father. I know the rattle of the
cart wheel.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I say it was not; and take care how you say a word
about ever having gone into the field, and about my having
returned to the Cellars.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why, uncle?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Because Ash will summons me for trespass, and because
my horse ate the grass. That’s one reason; but
there’s a better one—I don’t choose that you should
speak.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Kate was accustomed to his rough manner, and she did
not answer.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then Pasco’s mind began to work on the theme that
had occupied it before. He had been seen driving out of
Coombe with Kate at his side. But what of that? Would
it not be a sufficient answer to give, were she not to be
seen again, that he had met Jason Quarm on the road, and
that the man had taken his daughter with him, and that
thereupon both had perished in the flames?</p>

<p class='c001'>The more he considered the matter, the more essential
to his security did it seem to him that Kate should be got
rid of. The only embarrassment he felt was as to the
means to be employed, and the place where it was to be
done. Not till she was removed could the weight now
oppressing his mind be cast off.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Uncle,” said Kate after a long course in silence, “I
cannot think how that lucifer acts, if there be no flint
and no steel. How else can the match be made to
light?”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>“How is no matter to me—kindle it does, somehow.”
Then, abruptly, “Have you got your cotton dress on?
The wind is from the east and chilly.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh no, uncle, I have on my thick woollen dress,
and am very warm—thank you kindly for considering
me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The thick wool, is it?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, uncle—very sure, very thick and warm.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then that would not do. It had occurred to him to
drop a lighted match on her frock, set her in flames, and
throw her out into the road at a lonely spot. No, that
would not do. He reversed his whip and beat the cob
with the handle.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Diamond is not going badly, uncle,” said Kate in mild
remonstrance.</p>

<p class='c001'>He was in reality trying the weight of the whip handle
and the stiffness of the stem. That would not effect his
purpose; there was no metal to signify at the butt-end.
The horse did not greatly mind a blow dealt it with a full
swing of its master’s arm.</p>

<p class='c001'>Pasco bore no malice against his niece. In his cold
fashion he liked her. She was useful in the house, and
saved him the expense of a maid. It was doubtful whether
any servant would have been as submissive to Zerah as was
Kitty, whether any would have continued so long in service
to her. He had forgotten his momentary resentment at
Kate refusing the offer of John Pooke. He wished the
girl ill for no other reason than his own safety. Had he
been able to send her away, out of the country, that would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>have satisfied him. But as there was no opportunity for
getting her out of the way without hurt to himself, she
must be removed by such means as were possible to
him.</p>

<p class='c001'>How to do this, and where to do it, remained undecided.
Not where he then was could it be attempted, for he was
now approaching Newton. The lights were twinkling through
the trees, cottages were passed with illumined windows, and
sometimes with persons standing in the doors.</p>

<p class='c001'>On entering Newton, Pepperill turned his horse’s head to
make a detour, so as to avoid passing the inn that had been
rebuilt after having been burnt down. For some reason
undefined in his own heart, he shrank from driving before
that house.</p>

<p class='c001'>In a few minutes the cob was trotting along the Ashburton
road. Pasco looked behind him. He heard the sound of
the hoofs of another horse, and the rattle of other wheels.
Some traveller was on the road that night.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Uncle,” said Kate, “I think the moon is going to
rise.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I suppose so.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Will it not be grand on the moor, with the moon shining
over it, and the Dart flowing like silver below?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Silver? I wish it were silver, and I’d pocket it,” growled
Pasco. “Dang it! what is that which is following?”</p>

<p class='c001'>He slackened his pace, but the conveyance did not pass
him; it approached, and the driver was content to keep in
the rear.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Will you go on?” shouted Pasco, turning his head.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>“No, we’ll remain as we are,” answered the driver.</p>

<p class='c001'>“How far are you going?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“To Ashburton.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Well, thought Pasco, the loneliest, wildest part of the
road is that between Ashburton and Brimpts.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXXV <br /><span class='small'>UNSUCCESSFUL</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c010'>On leaving Ashburton, Pasco Pepperill was relieved of
the attendance which had been so irksome to him.
He would not, probably, have carried out his purpose
between Newton and Ashburton, as that was a high road,
much frequented, running through cultivated lands, and
with farms and cottages along it at no great intervals.
Nevertheless, the knowledge irritated him that someone was
following him, that should an opportunity otherwise propitious
arise, he could not seize it because of the man in the trap
at his heels. Never able clearly to bring all contingencies
together before his inward eye, in the conduct of his business,
he was now more dull and confused in mind than usual.</p>

<p class='c001'>He took it into his head that there was something
menacing in the pursuit; that the man in his rear was
aware of what he had done at the Cellars, that he foresaw
his present purpose, and was intentionally following him,
keeping him in sight, either that he might deliver him up
to justice for what he had done, or to prevent the execution
of his present design.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was consequently with immense relief that he heard
the man’s cheery “Good-night,” and his wheels turn off by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>a by-street, as he trotted through Ashburton and along the
road leading to Dart-meet and Brimpts.</p>

<p class='c001'>At a distance of rather over a mile from Ashburton the
Dart is crossed, then the road climbs a steep hill, cutting
off the great sweep made by the river as it flows through
Holne Chase, and it crosses the river again as it bursts from
the moor at Newbridge. Nearly the whole of this way is
through woods, and does not pass a single human habitation.</p>

<p class='c001'>Directly New Bridge is crossed, the character of the
surroundings changes. In place of rock and woods of pine
and oak and beech, succeed the solitude and desolation of
moorland, heather, and furze brake, with at one spot only
a cluster of small cottages about a little inn, with a clump
of sycamores behind them and a few acres of mountain
pasture before them, laboriously cleared of granite boulders.
Immediately after passing this hamlet, the road traverses
moorland entirely uninhabited. Tors rise to the height of
from twelve to fifteen hundred feet; their sides are strewn
with rocky ruin. Dense masses of furze cover the moorland
sweeps, and between the clefts of the rocks whortleberry grows
rankly into veritable bushes, hung in June with purple berries.
Below, at the depth of a thousand feet, foams and roars the
Dart amidst boulders and bushes of mountain-ash and thorn.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was obvious to the clouded mind of Pepperill that if
he was to get rid of Kitty, it must be done either in the
Holne Wood or on the moor. One place was as good as
the other for disposal of the child’s body; the dense forest
growth or the equally dense whortle and furze would
effectually conceal it.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>When the first Dart bridge was crossed, and the steep
ascent begun, Pepperill said roughly to his niece—</p>

<p class='c001'>“You ain’t going to sit here and make the horse drag you
all the way up this tremendous hill, be you?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, uncle dear; I was only waiting for you to draw up
that I might jump out. Do you see the moon coming up
behind the trees, shining through them, like a good thought
in the midst of dark imaginings?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Dang the moon and your imaginings! Get out.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I was thinking of something my book says,” apologised
Kate, descending to the road.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Your book? What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I mean that which the schoolmaster gave me, which I
have read and read, and in which I always find something
new, and always am sure of something true.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What does the book say?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I learned it by heart—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Within the soul a faculty abides,</div>
      <div class='line'>That with interpositions’—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>That means things which come between. He explained
that to me. I cannot always make out what is said till it
is explained; but when it is, then the full truth and loveliness
rises and shines into me like the moon when it has got
over the hills and the woods.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Go on.”</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>“‘A faculty abides,</div>
      <div class='line'>That with interpositions, which would hide</div>
      <div class='line'>And darken, so can deal that they become</div>
      <div class='line'>Contingencies of pomp, and serve to exalt</div>
      <div class='line'>Her native brightness.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>I did not understand what contingencies meant, but he told
me, and now all is quite plain as it is quite true. And it
goes on—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>‘As the ample moon</div>
      <div class='line'>Rising behind a thick and lofty grove,</div>
      <div class='line'>Burns like an unconsuming fire, light</div>
      <div class='line'>In the green trees’”—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“Cease this foolery,” said Pasco impatiently. He was
fumbling in his pocket for his clasp-knife, and was opening
it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do look, uncle dear!” exclaimed Kate, turning to
observe the moon as it mounted over the rich Buckland
Woods on the farther bank of the Dart.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Halt,” shouted Pasco to the horse.</p>

<p class='c001'>They had reached an eminence. The girl stood wrapped
in delight, with the silver shield of the moon before her,
casting its glorious light over her face and folded hands.
Pasco had his knife out. She heard the click, as the spring
nipped the blade firmly, but did not turn to see what
occasioned the sound.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The moon has come up out of the trees just as he said—I
mean the poet—like a power in the heart and soul that
has been entangled in all kinds of dark and twisted matters
of every day. Oh, uncle, what is that?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Pasco drew back. A white dog—a mongrel, short-haired
lurcher—crossed the road. Simultaneously a whistle was
heard, and this was answered by another in the distance.</p>

<p class='c001'>“There are poachers about,” said Pepperill. He shut his
knife, pocketed it, and called Kate to get into the trap.
He was not going to halt to see a darned moon rise, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>all kinds of vagabonds were about, and there was no safety
for honest men.</p>

<p class='c001'>Pasco drove rapidly down the hillside into the Dart
Valley at New Bridge. The road was mostly in shadow,
but the bare moor on the farther side was white in the
moonlight, as though it had been snowed over. The horse
was tired, and tripped. Pasco had to be on his guard lest
the beast should fall. In the shadow of the trees it could
not see the stones that strewed the way. At the bottom of
the valley flowed the Dart; the rush of the water breaking
over the rocks was audible.</p>

<p class='c001'>“If a harm came to you or me in the river, I reckon
the body would be washed right away to Sharpitor,” said
Pepperill.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Uncle!” said Kate, with a laugh, “that would be going
up hill.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I’m getting mazed,” growled he; “so it is. Well, folk
would say one or other of us had come by an accident
among the rocks o’ Sharpitor, and tumbled into the river
and been carried down by the stream. That’s likely—eh?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I suppose so, uncle. But if anything were to happen
to one, that the other would know, and do all he could to
help.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Of course.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Pepperill was looking at the brawling torrent.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And if anything were to chance to one here, the body
would be carried right down the Chase for miles till it came
to the other bridge.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>“I daresay, uncle. But don’t talk like that. Let us
look at the moonlight. There is a man yonder—by the
side of the river.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“A man—where?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“By that large stone.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He is catching salmon. Not a fish has a chance up
here on the moor. What a parcel of rascals there
be!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Pepperill drove across the bridge. He had intended—he
hardly dared articulately to express to himself his
intention. Again he was frustrated—just at a suitable
point—by this fellow catching salmon by night.</p>

<p class='c001'>Beyond the bridge the road rose rapidly. Both uncle
and niece were forced to descend from the cart, and relieve
the horse. Some six hundred feet had to be mounted
without any zigzags in the road. Kate walked along
cheerily. Pasco lagged behind. The horse, with nose
down, laboriously stepped up the steep incline. Pasco
took out his knife and cut a branch of thorn from the
hedge, and in doing so tore his fingers. He put the thorn
behind the seat.</p>

<p class='c001'>When the summit of the hill was almost reached, he
said to Kate, “I shall turn to the left, and leave the
road.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What—out on the moor?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes; I think we can cut off a great curve and
avoid the cottages. You walk by the horse’s head; I will
mount and hold the reins. There are large stones in the
way.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>This was the case. Kate thought that her uncle was
rash in taking the track across the moor at night, a way he
could not know, merely to save a mile that the road made
in detour. But she said nothing. She was pleased to go
by a way that commanded the gorge of the Dart, and had
no fear, as the moon shone brilliantly, and every bush
and stone was visible as in the day. The mica and spar
in the granite made each rock sparkle as though encrusted
with diamonds. A heavy dew had fallen, cobwebs hanging
on the furze were as silvery fairy tissue.</p>

<p class='c001'>Rabbits were out sporting, feeding, darting away with a
gleam of snowy tail when alarmed. Owls were flitting and
hooting in the ravine. The wind from the east hummed
an Æolian strain in the moor grass and heather.</p>

<p class='c001'>The moon rose high above all obstruction to its placid
light, and Kate breathed slowly, and in the chill air her
breath came away as a fine shining vapour. Every now
and then the cob struck out a red fire-spark from the stones
against which his shoe struck. Kate held the reins at the
bit, and paced at his head, her heart swelling with
happiness, as she drank in the loveliness of the night, till
she was so full of the beauty that her eyes began to fill.
Pasco Pepperill was silent. He was knotting the thorn-branch
to his whip. His eye was on her.</p>

<p class='c001'>Presently the track on the turf ran at the edge of a steep
slope. Rocks from a tor overhead had fallen and strewn
the incline, and formed fantastic objects in the moonlight,
casting shadows even more fantastic. A sheep that had
been sleeping under one of the rocks started up and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>bounded away. The spring of the sheep close beside him
alarmed the horse, and he started back, plunged, and
dragged Kate off her feet.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then, with a cry of rage, Pasco rose in the cart, whirled
his whip about, and lashed the cob with the full force of
his arm, at the same time that he raised the reins in his
left and beat with them as well, and jerked at the brute’s
mouth.</p>

<p class='c001'>Kate was down. She had slipped; she was before the
plunging beast. Pasco saw it. He swore, lashed this side,
that, then at the flanks, at the head, at the belly of the
tortured brute, that leaped and staggered, kicked and
reeled under the strokes of the thorns which tore his skin.
He snorted, reared, put down his head; the steam came
off him in a cloud.</p>

<p class='c001'>There was one thing the beast would not do—rush
forward and trample on the fallen girl. Pasco saw it, and
cursed the horse. He flung himself from the trap, he
rushed at the bridle; his foot was on Kate’s gown.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Uncle! uncle!” she cried.</p>

<p class='c001'>With one hand he dragged the horse forward, with the
other he swung the thorn-bush. A step, and the hoofs and
wheels of the horse and cart would be over the girl. Then
a thrust would suffice to send her down the side of the
slope into the torrent below.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the brute leaped into the air before the swinging
thorn-bush, swerved up hill, dragging Pasco at his head,
and flung him over a rock. His hand became entangled;
he could not for a moment disengage it; he was dragged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>forward; the head-gear gave way, and Pasco fell among the
bushes, crying out with rage and pain. Next moment
Kate stood before him.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What is the matter, uncle dear? Are you hurt? I
am safe.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXXVI <br /><span class='small'>ALL IN VAIN</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c010'>Pasco Pepperill staggered to his feet, and at once
felt pain in one ankle.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Are you hurt, dear uncle?” again inquired Kate.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Hurt? I’ve strained and bruised myself all over. My
right arm—my leg—I can hobble only. Where’s the trap?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If you have no bones broken, uncle, sit down, and I
will see after Diamond.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The horse was browsing unconcernedly at no great distance.
Too tired to run far, too hungry to heed his wounds,
he had at once applied himself to the consumption of the
sweet moorland grass. Happily the cart was uninjured.
It had not been upset, and no more of the harness was
broken than a strap at the head. The cob allowed Kate to
approach and take him by the forelock without remonstrance.
He knew Kate, who had been accustomed to
fondle him, and who, in the absence of friends of her own
order, had made one of the brute beast. She managed to
fasten up the broken strap and replaced the headstall; then
she drew the horse along to where her uncle sat rubbing
his leg and arm.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>“It’s the right arm, drat it!” said Pasco; “won’t I only
give that cursed beast a leathering when I can use my
arm again!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Surely, uncle, poor Diamond was going on all right till
you beat him. He is so patient that he does not deserve
a beating. There is a thorn branch about which the whip
has become entangled. I suppose that must have hurt
him, poor fellow. He was good, too; when my foot
slipped and I fell, he would not trample on me. You were
beating him, uncle, and did not see where I was. Just
think how good he was!—notwithstanding the thorns, yet
he would not tread on me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh yes, that is all you think about, you selfish minx,
your own self. Because you are uninjured, you don’t care
for me who am bruised all over.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It was of no use pursuing the matter. Kate knew her
uncle’s unreasonable moods, so she changed the subject
and asked, “What is to be done now? shall we go on along
the moor or turn back?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is of no use going along the moor now. We may
come to some other darned accident with this vile brute.
Lead him back along our tracks to the road. I don’t want
to be thrown out again. This is the second time he has
treated me in this manner. If I had a gun, I’d shoot him.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Uncle, that other occasion was no fault of his. You
were driving the schoolmaster, and Walter Bramber told
me about it—you sent the wheel against a stone.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Of course the blame is mine, and this time also. The
horse is innocent.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>“If you had not beaten poor Diamond”—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Go on with the cart, and hold your tongue.”</p>

<p class='c001'>But Pasco walked with pain. He had not taken many
steps before he asked to be helped up into the trap.</p>

<p class='c001'>Kate led the horse and spoke caressingly to the brute,
that was greatly fagged with the long journey without a
break he had taken that evening. Usually he would be
given an hour’s rest and a feed at Ashburton, before the
worst and most arduous portion of the journey was taken;
but on this occasion he had been urged on at his fastest
pace and never allowed to slacken it, and not given any
rest, not even a mouthful of water, at Ashburton. No
wonder that he tripped.</p>

<p class='c001'>Pasco looked sullenly before him at the girl walking in
the moonlight, speaking to the horse. The chance of
doing her an injury was past. He could with difficulty
move his arm. If he drew his knife on her and attacked
her there on the moor, she could run from him, and he
would be unable to pursue her, owing to his sprained
ankle.</p>

<p class='c001'>There was no help for it, he must make the best of the
circumstances, threaten her if she showed an inclination to
speak and compromise him. Perhaps, taken all in all, it
was as well that his purpose had been frustrated. There
was no telling; he might have got into difficulties had he
killed her. In escaping from one danger, he might have
precipitated himself into another.</p>

<p class='c001'>He saw now what he had not seen before. It had been
his intention to attribute the fire to Jason Quarm. Had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>Kitty disappeared according to his purpose, then he would
have said she had returned to Coombe with her father. It
was known that she had left the place in his own company
in the trap. She had been seen by the publican and by
the miller. But it was possible, it was probable, that Jason
had been seen as he drove through Coombe to the Cellars.
If so, then it would have been observed that he was alone;
accordingly his—Pasco’s—story of her return with her
father would have been refuted. Then, what explanation
could he have given of her disappearance?</p>

<p class='c001'>Pepperill drew a long breath. He had been preserved
from making a fatal mistake. He was glad now that his
attempt on Kate had been frustrated.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then, again, a new idea entered his brain. Could he
not have attributed her death to accident on the moor, had
the horse trampled on her? He might have done so, but
then, would not folks have thought there was something
more than coincidence in the death, the same night, of
father and daughter?</p>

<p class='c001'>“I believe I’d ha’ been a stoopid if I’d ha’ done it,”
said Pasco, and resigned himself to circumstances. “Be us
in the road? I reckon us be.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, uncle; here is where we turned off from the
highway. Which turn shall I take—on to Brimpts or back
to Ashburton?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“On ahead, Brimpts way. There’s a little public-house
at Pound Gate, and I be that dry, and the cob, I reckon,
be that lazy—we’d best turn in there and rest the night.
The shaking of the cart hurts me, moreover.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>Kate got up into the vehicle and drove. Her uncle gladly
resigned the reins to her. He could have held them,
indeed, but not have used the whip, and Diamond would
not go with him unless he used the whip.</p>

<p class='c001'>Before long the little tavern was reached—a low building
of moorstones, whitewashed, with a thatched roof, and a
sign over the door.</p>

<p class='c001'>To the surprise of Pepperill, he saw a chaise without
horses outside.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the inn he drew up. The landlord came to the door
and helped him to descend.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What! hurt yourself, Mr. Pepperill?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes; had a spill.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“On your way to Brimpts, I suppose? I hear you are
selling the timber.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, to Government. Have you visitors?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ay! Some one come after you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“After me?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Notwithstanding his bad ankle, Pasco started back. Had
his face not been in shadow, the landlord might have
observed how pale he had become.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What! come from Coombe?” he asked in a faltering
voice.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Hardly that, master,” answered the landlord. “Not
likely <em>that</em> when you be come from there. No, o’ course,
came t’other road. He asked about you at Brimpts, and
then drove on. He’s purposing to sleep the night here,
and was intending to push on to Coombe to-morrow. He’s
ordered some supper, and my old woman ha’ done him a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>couple of rashers and some eggs. Have you a mind to
join him?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But who is he? What does he want?” Pasco was
still uneasy.</p>

<p class='c001'>“A sort of a lawyer chap.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“A lawyer?” Pepperill hobbled to his trap. “I’ll push
on, thank ye, I’ll not stay.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nay, you’d better. I hold wi’ you, master, that it is
best in general to give clear room to lawyers. But this
time I don’t think but you’d safest come in. He’ll do you
no hurt, and maybe he brings you good, Mr. Pepperill.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I’ll go on,” said Pasco decidedly. “I hate all lawyers
as I do ravens.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Halloo! What is this?” A gentleman put his head
out of the bar parlour window, which was open. “Who is
it that hates lawyers? Not Mr. Pepperill?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Pasco attempted to scramble into his trap.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Is that Mr. Pepperill, of Coombe Cellars? You must
stay. I have a word to speak with you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I won’t stay—not a minute.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I’ll not charge you six-and-eight. Yet it is something
to your advantage. I’m Mr. James Squire, solicitor,
Tavistock. I have come about your affairs. Your old
uncle, Sampson Blunt, is dead—died of a stroke—sudden—and
you come in for everything. What say you now?
Will you stay? Will you put up your horse? Will you
come in and have some of my rasher and eggs? I’m
drinking stout—what will you take? You won’t drive any
farther to-night, I presume? Sampson has died worth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>something like three thousand pounds; and every penny
comes to you, except what Government claims as pickings—probate
duty, you understand.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Three thousand pounds?” gasped Pasco.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ay, not a guinea under, and it may be more. His
affairs haven’t been properly looked into yet. I came off
post-haste, took a chaise from Tavistock, didn’t think to
meet you. Was coming on to-morrow. An apoplectic
stroke. No children, no one else to inherit but yourself,
the only heir-at-law. Now, then, what do you say? Rum
and milk, they tell me, is the moor tipple, but I go in for
stout.”</p>

<p class='c001'>With glazed eyes and open mouth stood Pasco Pepperill,
his hands fallen at his side; he seemed as though he had
been paralysed.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Three thousand five hundred—there’s no saying,”
continued Mr. Squire, through the window. “Look sharp,
come in, or the rashers and eggs will be cold. I asked for
a chop. Couldn’t have it. Pleaded for a steak. No good.
No butchers on the moor. So ham and eggs, and ham salt
as brine. Never mind—drink more. Come in.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then the head of the lawyer disappeared behind the
blind, and the click of his knife and fork was audible.</p>

<p class='c001'>Pasco tried to raise his right arm, failed, then he clapped
his left hand to his brow.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Good heavens!” he almost shouted; “I’ve done it all
for naught.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Done what?” asked the innkeeper.</p>

<p class='c001'>Pasco recovered himself.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>“Nothing. I am stunned. This has turned my head.
Lend me your arm. I must go in. No—I must return
home—get me another horse—I cannot stay. Quick; I
must return—oh, be quick.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, that’s coorious!” said the landlord. “I reckon
you ought to go in and listen to what the lawyer has to
say, first. As for horses, I don’t keep ’em, and the lawyer’s
post-horses be gone into the stable for the night.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Lend me your arm,” said Pepperill. “I don’t know
right what I’m about. This has come on me quite
unexpected.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I wish three thousand pounds’d come unexpected on
me,” replied the host.</p>

<p class='c001'>Pasco entered the room where the lawyer was eating.</p>

<p class='c001'>“That’s right,” said the latter. “Take a snack. There’s
some for all, I say, with my rasher, and you may say so
with your legacy, and give me a slice off your dish. Polly—a
plate and knife and fork for the gentleman.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Pepperill seated himself. He was as if stupefied. Then
he put both elbows on the table, though the movement of
his right arm pained him, and began to cry.</p>

<p class='c001'>“That’s what I like,” said the lawyer. “Feeling, sentiment.
It’s what we all ought to do. Amen. When
grieving is done, there’s a couple of eggs left. But I like
that. Heart in the right place. Quite so. What is your
tipple? That’s very nice. Feeling—I love it. I didn’t
know, though, that you had seen your uncle for twenty
years, and cared twopence about him. P’r’aps you didn’t
in times gone by; now, of course, it’s different with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>three thousand pounds. I respect your emotion; I love
it. But cry when you go to bed. Eat now. There is a
place and there is a time for everything. It does you
credit, I shall make a point of mentioning it—no extra
charge.”</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='small'>The announcement of a new volume of poetry from Mr. Kipling will excite wide

<p class='c018'><span class='small'>Few announcements will be more welcome to lovers of English verse than the one
that Mr. Henley is bringing together into one book the finest lyrics in our
language. Robust and original the book will certainly be, and it will be produced
with the same care that made ‘Lyra Heroica’ delightful to the hand and

Baring Gould, who in this book returns to the field in which he won his spurs.
This volume consists of the old stories which have been dear to generations of

of ‘Irish Idylls’ has gained her a wide reputation, has told the story in spirited
flowing verse, and Mr. Bedford’s numerous illustrations and ornaments are as
spirited as the verse they picture. The book will be one of the most beautiful

record of what is now known, both of dated monuments and of events, from
the prehistoric age down to modern times. For the earlier periods every trace of
the various kings will be noticed, and all historical questions will be fully discussed.
The volumes will cover the following periods;—</span></p>
<p class='c023'><span class='small'>I. Prehistoric to Hyksos times. By Prof. Flinders Petrie. II. xviiith to xxth
Dynasties. III. xxist to xxxth Dynasties. IV. The Ptolemaic Rule.
V. The Roman Rule. VI. The Muhammedan Rule.</span></p>
<p class='c024'><span class='small'>The volumes will be issued separately. The first will be ready in the autumn, the
Muhammedan volume early next year, and others at intervals of half a year.</span></p>

<p class='c018'><span class='small'>This is a reprint of some excellent biographies of Elizabethan seamen, written by

and enough discernment to make him impartial.</span></p>

<p class='c024'><span class='small'>A companion book to Mr. Henley’s well-known ‘Lyra Heroica.’ It is believed that
no such collection of splendid prose has ever been brought within the compass of
one volume. Each piece, whether containing a character-sketch or incident, is

<p class='c018'><span class='small'>This book is the first serious attempt to describe the great barren tableland that
extends to the south of Limousin in the Department of Aveyron, Lot, etc., a
country of dolomite cliffs, and canons, and subterranean rivers. The region is
full of prehistoric and historic interest, relics of cave-dwellers, of mediæval
robbers, and of the English domination and the Hundred Years’ War. The
book is lavishly illustrated.</span></p>

6s.</em></p>
<p class='c018'><span class='small'>A volume dealing with the French Riviera from Toulon to Mentone. Without falling
within the guide-book category, the book will supply some useful practical
information, while occupying itself chiefly with descriptive and historical matter.
A special feature will be the attention directed to those portions of the Riviera,
which, though full of interest and easily accessible from many well-frequented
spots, are generally left unvisited by English travellers, such as the Maures
Mountains and the St. Tropez district, the country lying between Cannes, Grasse
and the Var, and the magnificent valleys behind Nice. There will be several
original illustrations.</span></p>

Fellow of New College, Oxford. <em>With numerous Plans. Crown
8vo. 6s.</em></p>
<p class='c026'><span class='small'>This book, by a well-known authority on military history, will be an important
contribution to the literature of the subject. All the great battles of English
history are fully described, connecting chapters carefully treat of the changes
wrought by new discoveries and developments, and the healthy spirit of patriotism
is nowhere absent from the pages.</span></p>

<p class='c018'><span class='small'>This book consists of (1) a succinct but complete biography of Lord Tennyson;
(2) an account of the volumes published by him in chronological order, dealing with
the more important poems separately; (3) a concise criticism of Tennyson in his
various aspects as lyrist, dramatist, and representative poet of his day; (4) a
bibliography. Such a complete book on such a subject, and at such a moderate
price, should find a host of readers.</span></p>

the English tongue.</span></p>
<p class='c026'><span class='small'>The ordinary ‘cheap edition’ appears to have served its purpose: the public has
found out the artist-printer, and is now ready for something better fashioned.
This, then, is the moment for the issue of such a series as, while well within the

owns, and a delight to the eye of him that reads.</span></p>
<p class='c026'><span class='small'>The series, of which Mr. William Ernest Henley is the general editor, will confine
itself to no single period or department of literature. Poetry, fiction, drama,
biography, autobiography, letters, essays—in all these fields is the material of
many goodly volumes.</span></p>
<p class='c026'><span class='small'>The books, which are designed and printed by Messrs. Constable, will be issued in
two editions—</span></p>
<p class='c025'>(1) A small edition, on the finest Japanese vellum, limited in most
cases to 75 copies, demy 8vo, 21<em>s.</em> a volume nett;</p>

yourself, half in envy and half in admiration: “Here is a <em>book</em>; here, or one is a

6s.</em></p>
<p class='c018'><span class='small'>A book on such subjects as Foundations, Gables, Holes, Gallows, Raising the Hat, Old

<p class='c018'><span class='small'>‘We have read Mr. Baring Gould’s book from beginning to end. It is full of quaint

Author of ‘Mehalah,’ etc. <em>Third Edition. Royal 8vo. 15s.</em></p>
<p class='c018'><span class='small'>‘A most splendid and fascinating book on a subject of undying interest. The great
feature of the book is the use the author has made of the existing portraits of the

line of research. It is brilliantly written, and the illustrations are supplied on a
scale of profuse magnificence.’—<em>Daily Chronicle.</em></span></p>
<p class='c018'><span class='small'>‘The volumes will in no sense disappoint the general reader. Indeed, in their way,
there is nothing in any sense so good in English.... Mr. Baring Gould has

</div>

<p class='c025'><span class='small'>‘To say that a book is by the author of “Mehalah” is to imply that it contains a
story cast on strong lines, containing dramatic possibilities, vivid and sympathetic
descriptions of Nature, and a wealth of ingenious imagery.’—<em>Speaker.</em></span></p>
<p class='c026'><span class='small'>‘That whatever Mr. Baring Gould writes is well worth reading, is a conclusion that
may be very generally accepted. His views of life are fresh and vigorous, his
language pointed and characteristic, the incidents of which he makes use are
striking and original, his characters are life-like, and though somewhat exceptional
people, are drawn and coloured with artistic force. Add to this that his
descriptions of scenes and scenery are painted with the loving eyes and skilled
hands of a master of his art, that he is always fresh and never dull, and under
such conditions it is no wonder that readers have gained confidence both in his
power of amusing and satisfying them, and that year by year his popularity
widens.’—<em>Court Circular.</em></span></p>

<p class='c037'><b>Corelli.</b> BARABBAS: A DREAM OF THE WORLD’S TRAGEDY. By <span class='sc'>Marie Corelli</span>, Author of ‘A Romance of Two
Worlds,’ ‘Vendetta,’ etc. <em>Eleventh Edition. Crown 8vo. 6s.</em></p>
<p class='c018'><span class='small'>Miss Corelli’s new romance has been received with much disapprobation by the
secular papers, and with warm welcome by the religious papers. By the former
she has been accused of blasphemy and bad taste; ‘a gory nightmare’; ‘a hideous
travesty’; ‘grotesque vulgarisation’; ‘unworthy of criticism’; ‘vulgar redundancy’;
‘sickening details’—these are some of the secular flowers of speech.
On the other hand, the ‘Guardian’ praises ‘the dignity of its conceptions, the
reserve round the Central Figure, the fine imagery of the scene and circumstance,
so much that is elevating and devout’; the ‘Illustrated Church News’ styles the
book ‘reverent and artistic, broad based on the rock of our common nature, and
appealing to what is best in it’; the ‘Christian World’ says it is written ‘by one
who has more than conventional reverence, who has tried to tell the story that it
may be read again with open and attentive eyes’; the ‘Church of England
Pulpit’ welcomes ‘a book which teems with faith without any appearance of
irreverence.’</span></p>

<p class='c018'><span class='small'>A story of society by a new writer, full of interest and power, which has attracted
by its brilliance universal attention. The best critics were cordial in their
praise. The ‘Guardian’ spoke of ‘Dodo’ as <em>unusually clever and interesting</em>;
the ‘Spectator’ called it <em>a delightfully witty sketch of society</em>; the ‘Speaker’
said the dialogue was <em>a perpetual feast of epigram and paradox</em>; the
‘Athenæum’ spoke of the author as <em>a writer of quite exceptional ability</em>;
the ‘Academy’ praised his <em>amazing cleverness</em>; the ‘World’ said the book was

<p class='c018'><span class='small'>The ‘Glasgow Herald’ says that ‘the scenery is admirable, and the dramatic incidents
are most striking.’ The ‘Westminster Gazette’ calls the book ‘strong,
interesting, and clever.’ ‘Punch’ says that ‘you cannot put it down until you

‘Mademoiselle de Mersac.’ <em>Third Edition. Crown 8vo. 6s.</em></p>
<p class='c018'><span class='small'>‘The characters are delineated by the author with his characteristic skill and
vivacity, and the story is told with that ease of manners and Thackerayean insight
which give strength of flavour to Mr. Norris’s novels. No one can depict
the Englishwoman of the better classes with more subtlety.’—<em>Glasgow Herald.</em></span></p>
<p class='c018'><span class='small'>‘Mr. Norris has drawn a really fine character in the Duke of Hurstbourne, at once
unconventional and very true to the conventionalities of life, weak and strong in
a breath, capable of inane follies and heroic decisions, yet not so definitely portrayed
as to relieve a reader of the necessity of study on his own behalf.’—<em>Athenæum.</em></span></p>
<p class='c017'><b>Parker.</b> MRS. FALCHION. By <span class='sc'>Gilbert Parker</span>, Author of
‘Pierre and His People.’ <em>New Edition. 6s.</em></p>
<p class='c018'><span class='small'>Mr. Parker’s second book has received a warm welcome. The ‘Athenæum’ called
it <em>a splendid study of character</em>; the ‘Pall Mall Gazette’ spoke of the writing as
<em>but little behind anything that has been done by any writer of our time</em>; the
‘St. James’s’ called it <em>a very striking and admirable novel</em>; and the ‘Westminster

<em>Crown 8vo. 5s.</em></p>
<p class='c029'><span class='small'>‘The plot is original and one difficult to work out; but Mr. Parker has done it with
great skill and delicacy. The reader who is not interested in this original, fresh,
and well-told tale must be a dull person indeed.’—<em>Daily Chronicle.</em></span></p>
<p class='c029'><span class='small'>‘A strong and successful piece of workmanship. The portrait of Lali, strong, dignified,
and pure, is exceptionally well drawn.’—<em>Manchester Guardian.</em></span></p>

etc. New and Cheaper Edition. <em>Crown 8vo. 6s.</em></p>
<p class='c018'><span class='small'>‘Mr. Pryce’s work recalls the style of Octave Feuillet, by its clearness, conciseness,
its literary reserve.’—<em>Athenæum.</em></span></p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
